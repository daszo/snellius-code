Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & \nDocumentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.  He \nwas knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book \nadministrator in a previous life.  Have you considered him?  Give me a couple \nof days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get \nback with you.  --Sally  \n\nWell, we're a few years behind you, but one of my goals is to set up a \nconfirm desk for EES.  John Echols told me he gave you a call to see whether \nthere were any candidates from your shop for whom this might be an \nopportunity.  Please let me know if  any background or perspective would be \nhelpful. \nthanks."}

{"id": "7936", "contents": "Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast\nDear Eric,  We're going to make it through the winter - the North American Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment on Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should meet or exceed estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer look at the assessment on Wednesday.   On Wednesday, Interior Secretary Gale Norton talks about the upcoming Lease Area 181 sale.  Secretary Norton believes there's still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on December 5.   The FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday in how it looks at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau on Wednesday from Megawatt Daily Editor Michael Lustig and Electric Power Supply Association President Lynne Church.  Lustig joins us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast and Church is stopping by at  10:00 a.m. ET.   ENL's Kym McNicholas will also have reaction to Tuesday's FERC ruling.  On Wednesday, she'll bring us comments from Mirant, the California Department of Water Resources and the California ISO.  And during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Independent Energy Producers Association State Policy Manager Katie Kaplan will join us from the West Coast bureau to give us her take on the FERC's actions.   Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regional Manager Leonard Spearman is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday. He'll talk about the TNRCC's role in strengthening homeland security at Texas petrochemical plants and refineries.  Catch the Spearman interview during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a new twist in the search for alternatives to MTBE.  Chris Paschall of Industry Information Resources will talk about the possibility of making ethanol out of wine vines - potential good news for California.  Join us from Houston on Wednesday.

{"id": "6808", "contents": "RE: Call to SCE Regarding Negative CTC Credits\nUnless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning.  \nI'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however.  We'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in, for that matter. \nReliant and Mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up.  They would of course love to have Enron \"lead the charge.\"  I would recommend that we not play that card right now and let Reliant and Mirant go forward if they choose.\nBest,\nJeff\n\nSteve -- \nIf you have not called SCE yet, now may be a good time to do so (given the failure of the Legislature to resolve their problems).  \nJim \n\nAttorney-Client Privileged Communication \nSteve, \nRick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our \"Negative CTC Credits\" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.\nToday Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?\nPlease call me if you wish to discuss. \nThanks."}

This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.

{"id": "3448", "contents": "RE:  International Travel\nI'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.\nIn a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.\nFrom her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.\nFeel free to give me a call if you want to chat.\nGood luck!\nMark\n\nAmerican that I have to do it through Cunard.  Do you have a contact over\nthere?  If not I'll just do the 800 number thing.\nI want her to come home.  We will take a stateside vacation over the next\nweek and not linger over there.  What is your opinion?  Did you feel unsafe\nthere?  There is a lot of sword rattling going on right now.\nBill"}

Bruce Power is 95% owned\nby British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two\nmain unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals\non the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.\nThis public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for\nthe Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.\nThe lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25\nyears. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three\ninstallments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to\nnormal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two\ninstallments of $112.5 M each.\nBruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The\nvariable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary\npayments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are\nestimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.\nBruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,\nother than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include\nthose that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support\nservices. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining\nthe necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.\n\"Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the\nelectricity consumer and the shareholder\" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President\nand CEO. \"This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities\nwhich in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.\nIt is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to\ncompetition and providing electricity consumers with choice.\" Osborne noted\nthat an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on\naccelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and\nPickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.\nNuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power\nGeneration, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies\nare committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.\n\"We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce\nPower will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,\"\nsaid Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy\nCanada Ltd. \"We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of\nthe staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the\nunions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial\nperformance.\"\nTo reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its\noperating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its\nshare of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to\nthe province 10 years after the market opens.\nBritish Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive\nprocess over the last two years. They have significant operating experience\nand a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.\nTo close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences\nfrom the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy\nBoard. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and\noperating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control\nBoard.\nOntario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating\ncompany. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to\nconsumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be\na premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation\nand wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and\nenvironmentally responsible manner.\nBritish Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British\nEnergy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United\nStates through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a\nworldwide electricity leader building on its \"Safety First\" culture and track\nrecord of commercial success.\nBACKGROUNDER INDEX\n------------------\nSafety:\n1.

{"id": "4313", "contents": "FW: West VAR\nTim\nYou will get stopped out.  I talked to David Port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var.  However, until its fixed I have no choice but to use the reported numbers.\n\nthe numbers being generated for the west's var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be.  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations.  for example, the ltnw book has a grant total of <3,000> MWh from now through September On-Peak and 194,000 MWh from now through September Off-Peak.  the var report shows mike with $20 million of var -- about $16 million of it coming between now and september.  we have a total var of $30 million, with about $20 million between now and september.  by my rough calculations, we would have to have the entire curve move roughly $100/MWh in one day for this var to be accurate.  that means that once every 20 days the entire summer curve -- peak and off-peak -- would have to move in excess of $100/MWh.  i might add that we are short q4 which i'm not giving us any credit for as an offset. \ni understand that there is a lot of risk on our books.  i just don't think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out.  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery.  we see the same thing with option valuations.  we see option model valuations (e.g., transmission spread options) going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality.  similarly, the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches.\nbottom line.  i need to know what you want us to do.  we are chewing up a lot of var.  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now.  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldn't necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the \"model\" happy."}

If you have trouble reading this email, please see the document on our website (www.pennfuture.org) under Pressroom & Publications.\n--------------------------------------\nAugust 10, 2001\nVol. 3, No. 15\nPittsburgh 2002: A Golden Opportunity For Renewable Energy\nThe end of large stranded cost charges to consumers will usher in a golden opportunity next year for the Pittsburgh area to become the renewable energy capital of America. In the Duquesne Light Service Territory in 1996, rates for some customers approached 50 percent above the national average, with residential customers paying more than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Of this 12 cents plus total, about 8.5 cents was for just generation.\nAnd what did consumers get for this premium 8.5 cents generation price, well above any price - including for today's 100 percent renewable energy products - seen in Pennsylvania's competitive retail market since 1997? Did they get clean and safe energy? Not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources.\nIn fact, the Pittsburgh area was powered by incredibly expensive nuclear plants that often were shut down more than they ran, as well as some of the highly polluting coal plants that kill 2,250 Pennsylvanians each year with microscopic dirt, cause acid rain, produce smog, and contribute to global warming. Both the pollution and the high costs were jammed down the throats of consumers by monopoly-friendly regulators.\nThose who challenged the legacy of high rates and dirty power and asked the old Pennsylvania monopoly utilities about renewable energy were often lectured that renewable energy technology would cost more or was not practical. Today's competitive retail market shows how wrong those lectures were. Right now in Pittsburgh, four competitive suppliers (two are Green-e certified) are offering 100 percent renewable energy products for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.5 cents per kWh. Those prices are less than the 8.5 cents Duquesne's customers paid for coal and nuke generation five years ago. In fact, they are more than a full cent less per kWh.\nSince renewable energy products exist in the marketplace, are exponentially cleaner, and cost less than Duquesne's traditional power products, why have they so far not swept the marketplace?\nCan You Say Stranded Costs or Competitive Transition Charges?\nCustomers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product, but also a regulatory stranded cost charge of up to 3.39 cents per kWh. On a system average basis, the stranded cost charge is 18 percent of each customer's total electric bill and for residential customers it is a whopping 27 percent of the total electric bill. The stranded cost charge is paid even if you switch from Duquesne Light to another company, and allows Duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated generation monopoly. Without the collection of stranded cost charges, Duquesne may have gone bankrupt.\nYet, adding the stranded cost charge to the otherwise less costly renewable energy products has the effect of increasing a customer's total bill when s/he bought renewable energy products. Thus stranded cost charges are a real barrier to renewable energy products and other competitive retail electric products.\nBut in 2002 in the Duquesne Light service territory, the regulatory ball and chain of stranded cost charges will be eliminated by giving a large total rate cut of probably 17 percent to all residential customers and by increasing the shopping credit from 4.89 cents to about 6.1 cents for residential customers. The removal of stranded cost charges means many Pittsburgh-area customers will soon be able to switch to renewable energy products and pay less or no more than what they were paying for electricity in 1996.\nYes, they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products. But the coming opportunity to power Pittsburgh with renewable energy and pay less than 1996 bills is a once-in-a-century chance.\nThe Duquesne Transition\nThe reason why Duquesne will be the first Pennsylvania utility to eliminate stranded cost charges is its successful sale of its generation plant. Duquesne first swapped some generating assets with FirstEnergy and then sold all of its generating assets to Orion, while contracting with Orion to continue to provide default service to Duquesne's native load customers. Duquesne has provided distribution service and Orion has provided default generation service at capped rates without notable problems.\nWithout a former monopoly utility with a vested interest in keeping generation customers, a far greater portion of customers switched to a competitive supplier than anywhere else in the U.S. Competitive suppliers now serve about 30 percent of all Duquesne customers. The number of Duquesne customers served by competitive suppliers rose steadily until peaking in late 2000 at about 185,000, held steady through spring 2001, and then declined to about 171,230 as of July 2001. The recent decline occurred when retail offers exceeded the system's shopping credit but remained well below Duquesne's 1996 generation rate of 8.5 cents.\nToday, there are four competitive suppliers offering six different products to residential customers in the Duquesne territory, one of which is priced below the shopping credit and enables customers to switch and save, and four of which are renewable energy products. Recent sharp declines of more than 50 percent in forward electric markets make it likely that more products will soon be able to beat the current Duquesne shopping credit of 4.89 cents and of course the 8.5-cent 1996 monopoly rate.\nAfter 2002, the two remaining principal impediments of completing a successful transition to competition in the Duquesne Light service territory will be the full integration of its control area and wholesale market into PJM and wide deployment of demand-response technologies. Time-of-use meters and appliance-control devices allow customers to profit from reducing usage in summer peak hours, protect reliability, reduce market power, and can lessen pollution. The failure to achieve PJM integration and demand response could derail the benefits of stranded cost elimination and what has been so far a successful transition for the Duquesne Service territory.\nNo More Stranded Costs!\nStranded cost charges will likely be first removed for residential customers starting in March 2002. Up until now, average system customers have had to pay 18 cents on every dollar paid for total electric service so that Duquesne could recover its stranded costs. With the end of stranded cost charges, different classes of customers (and different individual customers, depending on their usage) will receive a substantial rate cut.\nCurrent Prices for Electric Service from Duquesne Light\n(Rates in cents/kWh)\nRS Rate         GS         GL\nDistribution     4.263             2.453        0.475\nTransmission 0.250             0.257         0.119\nGeneration     8.50                 6.451        3.172\nCTC portion\nof Gen.             3.390             2.205         0.926\nShopping\nCredit             4.880                 4.246         2.246\nTotal             12.533                 8.085         3.646\nThe portion of the bill that is the \"Competitive Transition Charge\" represents the basic rate reduction that each class will enjoy when the charges are terminated. The charges are scheduled to end in March for general residential customers (RS), April for smaller commercial customers (GS), and September for larger commercial customers (GL). The charges end for other customer classes as late as April, 2004. Residential customers using 600 kWh/month, for example, will stop paying 3.39 cents/kWh for stranded costs, reducing their total electric bill by 27 percent.\nReal Market Prices\nGeneration rates will still be regulated for customers receiving default generation service under Duquesne's contract with Orion. However, the rates will no longer reflect the remnants of pre-restructuring cost-of-service rates. Instead, they will be based (imprecisely) on \"market rates.\" When the PUC approved the sale of Duquesne's generating plants and the transfer of the default service to Orion, it approved tentative default rates at \"market prices\" as determined by the Duquesne contract with Orion.\nThe precise level of default rates remains unknown, however. Consumers would see total rate reductions of about 21 percent if the default rate is set at 5.5 cents/kWh, and a total rate cut of 17 percent if it is pegged at 5.9 cents. Again, these default rates are well below the 8.5-cent 1996 monopoly rate.\nAlthough the Duquesne/Orion contract set and the PUC approved the default rates, the rates did not assume that Duquesne would be joining PJM West. There have been some non-public discussions taking place between the PUC, Orion, and Duquesne as well as some public discussions, but at this point it is unclear whether the existing rates should or will be adjusted. Whatever the precise answer, the PUC needs to move these proceedings to the public domain and resolve the issues expeditiously, so that customers and suppliers may plan to take advantage of the new market opportunities.\nCompetitive Market Opportunities\nIn 2002, the shopping credit will increase for customers who choose to buy generation from a competitive supplier instead of Orion's default service. Given reasonable assumptions about market prices and what the shopping credit may be, it appears that competitive suppliers will have substantial opportunities to provide competitive service at prices below the shopping credit. For example, if the present residential shopping credit of 4.88 cents/kWh is raised to 5.75 cents/kWh, as presently scheduled, consumers would have a modest opportunity to save by shopping in addition to the savings that all customers - including those remaining on default generation service - will experience from the end of stranded cost charges. If the residential shopping credit is increased to about 6.15 cents/kWh, suppliers competing on price would have a substantial opportunity to offer consumers meaningful savings by shopping.\nOne might presume that the 30 percent of all customers already shopping in the Duquesne service territory include many of those most interested in shopping. Will the opportunity to save a bit more after receiving a 17 percent rate decrease without shopping be sufficient to entice many of the remaining customers to shop? Setting the rate too low will provide a disincentive to shop by delivering even more savings to non-shopping customers who already will be getting a huge rate cut because of the end of the stranded cost charges. Given that \"market rates\" are a prediction that no one has been making accurately, perhaps the PUC should err on the high side to increase competitive market opportunities. There is no better time for doing so than when all customers are about to receive a huge rate cut from the elimination of stranded cost charges.\nRenewable Energy's Time is Now\nEven moderate additional shopping based on price does not mean a non-competitive market, however. Perhaps the most successful competitive suppliers will be those that offer products or services that encourage customers to switch for reasons other than price. Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and demand-side response products may well provide suppliers with the competitive edge.\nThe opportunity for renewable energy market penetration is, in fact, unprecedented. Two new wind farms are under construction at this time in Somerset and Fayette counties, bringing the total installed wind capacity in the region to about 34.4 megawatts (MW). Two additional wind farms are under development in the same area and another is under development about 30 miles across the state line in West Virginia, potentially bringing an additional 127-145 MW of wind power to serve the Pittsburgh market. Depending on the precise shopping credit, it is likely that wind electricity from these developments could be sold to retail customers at prices close to or not too far above the shopping credit.\nEven if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option, consumers would still be investing a portion of their 17 percent rate cut in renewable generation and still receive a reduction in their electric bill from what is now paid. For example, a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available to consumers in the Duquesne territory and still save from 1 cent to 2 cents per kWh. Alternatively, consumers probably will be able to buy 50 percent wind energy and still receive a total electric bill more than 5 percent less than it is today and was in 1996.\nLarge institutions, government agencies, businesses, and families can, without increasing their current electricity bills, become renewable energy consumers. With their choices, they can make Pittsburgh known far and wide as the first green-powered city.\n-----------------------------\nE-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications.

David Jones  \n\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is \"zero-rated\"  so it is not subject to the GST.\nWade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  \nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\nStacy\nx3-5705\n\nDo you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?\nThanks,\nKay\n\nOpps.  Didn't mean to hit send it just yet.  Much better now. \n\nToday we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, \"Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months\".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. \nTomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will \n1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to \n2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.\nKay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.

Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.\nData can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)\nData is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. \nSeveral steps have already been completed:\nThe physical file server environments for UBS have been established.\nThe physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.\nThe physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.\nSome file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.\nOur large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.\nWhere do we stand?\nI am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.\nLegal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)\nAt this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.\nWe have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.\nI will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.\nThanks, Steve"}

{"id": "6202", "contents": "Update: FFVols\nTed,\nAn update on the implementation for FFVols:\n(1) In comparing 6 days of historical Var calculations \n(with that of the implied) for Agg-Gas, we have found that the Historical VaR \ncalculations are consistently lower over this period, by roughly 17 MM.  The \nimplied volatilities are much higher at this period, anticipating strong \nwinter prices.\n(2) At this time, the consensus is not to relase the \nhistorical implementation into production, and the official line to traders \nwill be that the method is still in testing.  The historical VaR is 19.2MM \nand the implied is 37 MM for effective date of 09/25.    \n(3) Further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology \n(which I mentioned last week, whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio \nof prompt to historical-prompt volatilities), to atleast  capture some \nimplied/forward effects.  Tanya's analysis on a  fictitious portfolio \nindicates higher VaR numbers, but poorer backtesting in comparison to the \nhistorical approach.  This approach serves as an intermediate, and seems \nappropriate in periods such as the current one, wherein the historical \nnumbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied.\n(4) Winston will start  testing using these hybrid vols, and \nif the results are deemed satisfactory, that will be the production \nmethodology.\nOf course, we will obtain all VaR numbers concurrently to serve as different \nindicators and beacons of risk.  The production number will hopefully be a \nsensible compromise of the different methods. \nRegards\nNaveen"}

In that respect, I am forwarding a brief memo that we prepared a number of months ago (prior to PG&E's filing) regarding some of the issues/considerations that potentially would arise if Enron Wind were to file an involuntary petition against SCE.  The memo is a bit \"dated\" but I nonetheless thought it might be helpful to you to some extent in terms of setting forth some of the relevant considerations that arise in the involuntary context.  Please let me know if you would like any follow up on any of this prior to the call.

I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.\nEric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.

{"id": "9414", "contents": "FW: Powell Doctrine -- Read This One\nIt is a shame that Chairman Powell has waited so long to set an agenda for the FCC.  Some of these issues would be of interest to EBS, but I am afraid the timing may be too late.\n\nMona -- Sorry; I sent the wrong clipping the first time.  Here's the\nrelevant excerpt.  Aileen.\nPOWELL OUTLINES 5-POINT \nAGENDA FOR COMMISSION\nFCC Chairman Michael K. Powell today said he would apply his\nderegulatory, market-based philosophy to address a host of issues,\nthe most important of which will be spurring deployment of\nbroadband services.  \"The widespread deployment of broadband\ninfrastructure has probably become the central communications\npolicy objective today,\" he said at a press briefing in Washington.\nHe stressed the importance of the FCC taking actions to spur the\n\"digital broadband migration.\"  That could be an \"arduous\" process,\nhe said, but is \"essential to survival.\"  He outlined five areas\nthat he said would drive the FCC's agenda for the next several\nyears:  (1) broadband deployment, (2) competition policy, (3) spec-\ntrum allocation policy, (4) a reexamination of the foundation of\nmedia regulations, and (5) homeland security measures.\nShortly after he took over as chairman, Mr. Powell said he didn't\nhave a list of specific regulatory objectives that he planned to\npursue.  But today he sounded a different note.  \"It really\nstresses me that we don't have a more coherent, cognizant vision of\nwhat we're doing here,\" he said.  \"We're just running around\nreacting to the latest\" issues.  The initial work to act on his\nagenda will be started within six months and will be \"substantially\nunderway\" within a year, he said.\nVarious proceedings will be used to address his agenda, he said. \n\"What we're going to try to do is create clearly identifiable\nvehicles where key policy issues will be debated.\"  Otherwise, he\nsaid, \"the agency gets machine-gunned\" with petitions and other\nfilings from companies, trade groups, and other interested parties\ntrying to get action on particular issues.\nRegarding broadband services, Mr. Powell stressed the importance of\nlimiting regulations that inhibit deployment.  \"It is clear that\nsubstantial investment is required to build out the new networks,\nand we should limit regulatory costs and regulatory uncertainty,\"\nhe said.  \"Our focus should be on demonstrable and competitive\nrisks and discriminatory provisioning.\"\nAs it mulls broadband regulations, the FCC plans to continue\nstudying the market and working with states, he said.  The agency\nwill \"clarify regulatory classification and access obligations\nexpeditiously,\" he said.  He cited three proceedings that would\nfocus on broadband services:  (1) the ongoing new networks pro-\nceeding, (2) the cable open-access proceeding, and (3) the third-\ngeneration (3G) wireless spectrum allocation proceeding.\nRegarding competition, Mr. Powell said the Commission needed \"to\nmake prudent course corrections in our policies\" to spur\ncompetition.  \"Facilities-based competition is the ultimate\nobjective,\" he said.  He stressed the need for \"simplified\nenforceable connection rules.\"\nMore specifically, the chairman said the Commission would conclude\noutstanding \"phase I\" pricing flexibility proceedings and initiate\na set of new proceedings over the next six months \"that will pro-\nvide vehicles for rethinking our current framework.\"\nHe said a \"triennial review\" would provide the principle docket for\nevaluating unbundled network elements policy.  The Commission will\ninitiate a proceeding focusing on performance measurement and\nenforcement in an \"attempt to streamline the essential performance\nmeasures used for making judgments about compliance with the local\ncompetition provision,\" he added.\nHe also said the agency would initiate a \"dominance and non-\ndominance\" proceeding to \"ask how do we develop a framework that\nmight be used to deregulate on a carrier-specific or service-\nspecific basis, depending on the level of competition and market\npower.\"\nOn spectrum allocation, Mr. Powell found plenty of fault with the\nway the government doles out valuable frequencies.  \"The nation's\napproach to spectrum allocation is seriously fractured,\" he said,\nadding it was \"a politicized, reactive process.\"  He called for a\nmore comprehensive, market-driven policy that would allow spectrum\nusers to decide the best uses of bands.\nThe chairman said the Commission should encourage the development\nof secondary spectrum markets, improve interference protection\nstandards, back the development of unlicensed frequencies, map out\nthe uses and users of all spectrum, promote spectral efficiency,\nand protect frequencies used for public safety.\n-- Paul Kirby, pkirby@tr.com\nAileen A.

Will the swap work?\nFrank Gibney Jr./Houston\n08/28/2000\nTime Magazine\nTime Inc.\n38+\n(Copyright 2000)\nIt's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from \nBlockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for\nlast week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: \nnext year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500\nmovie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's \nright, video on demand (not the\nfrustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone \nwith a DSL line at home. \nWhat's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy \ncompany called Enron. At a time when\nso many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and \ntechnology of the digital age,\nEnron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most \ninnovative large company in America.\nFor years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed \nnatural gas. Then, as energy\nderegulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered \nit could make billions by trading and\nbrokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron \nis moving into the\ntelecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a \nfloor bulging with Sun\nsupercomputers.\nIn fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since \nmoving its trading operations from\nthe phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to \nmore than $30 billion. Most of that\nis made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk \nderivatives and now bandwidth--more than\n800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby \nGap pajamas, the company trades\n$600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. \nBoasts Enron president Jeffrey\nSkilling: \"In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online \nsite by a factor of 10.\" \nSo far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when \nyou're running the network, all sorts of\nprofitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas \nprices would spike this winter, Enron's\nin-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future \nsupplies at today's prices. And Enron's\nstock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of \nlike an Internet play, only better. \nThe market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come \nup with a business model that\nworks for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by \npackaging a supply of name your\ncommodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most \nprices. They arrived at this model back\nin the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had \ncollapsed, natural-gas deregulation had\nthrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just \nnationalized Enron's offshore properties.\nFiguring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to \nit--call it business judo-- Skilling, a\nMcKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas \nBank, to buy up reserves of natural\ngas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for \ndifferent customers. When electricity\nmarkets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the \noldest concept in business: buy low, sell\nhigh. \nEnron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big \ncustomers. Since 1997, companies like\nOwens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, \nmultibillion-dollar contracts with Enron\nsubsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up \nto 10 years and provide Enron with a\nsteady revenue stream. What's more, Enron is beginning to actively manage its \nclients' heating and cooling plants,\ninstalling new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the \nInternet. \nSkilling's latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the \npower and energy sectors to making Enron\na leader in the booming telecommunications business. The plan isn't to go \nhead to head with established fiber-optic\ncarriers such as AT&T, Qwest and Williams Communications. Instead, Enron \nwants to use new switching\ntechnology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest \ntelecom network into a powerful\narbiter of bandwidth. Enron's bet is simple: supply and demand will increase \nexponentially, turning bandwidth into a\ntradable commodity, just like gas and electricity. Along the way, why not \npartner with companies such as\nBlockbuster and use this new technology to offer content--like movies- -and \nblow it through existing, underutilized\npipe? \"They are jump- starting an application [telecom content] with a \npotential market of $200 billion a year,\" says\nTom Nolle, president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI. \nOther new-economy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a \nprize partner. IBM and AOL have\njoined with Enron to form the New Power Co. (TNPC), an independent start-up \nthat will offer pricing schemes and a\nchoice of power and gas service for residential and small-business customers. \nEnron provides the electricity; AOL\nenables customers to buy it via the Web; and IBM takes care of the billing. \n\"It's ludicrous that we're in the 21st\ncentury, and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters,\" says \nSkilling, pointing out that the\ntechnology exists to offer real-time pricing for gas and electricity. In \nderegulated markets, TNPC will allow\nconsumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies. \nDespite all Wall Street's enthusiasm for Enron's bold plans, there are still \nplenty of skeptics. Critics point out that\nthere is barely a market today for the company's bandwidth trading exchange. \nThey also stress that pushing digital\nsignals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas. Although there \nis plenty of cable across the country,\ncarriers are not set up to mix and match access to it. \"It's a very, very \ndifficult concept,\" says Nolles. Even the\nBlockbuster venture is risky: technology aside, there is also the highly \npolitical question of digital rights. How do\nyou satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure? \nBut Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought \nthey were crazy to try to make markets\nin gas and electricity. And Enron, after all, is a company that thrives on \nentrepreneurial defiance of convention.\nMany of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas \nin motion without waiting for\napproval from the top. Even the online operation was cobbled together in a \nmere seven months. Skilling and Lay\nfound out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live. \nIs taking risks really a part of a gas-pipeline company's culture? Just ask \nJohn Arnold, the 26-year-old chief of\nnatural-gas derivatives, who after nine hours and $1 billion in trades last \nWednesday had this to say: \"You can't turn\naway for a minute or you get picked off.\" That has happened to too many \ntraditional companies because they were\nunable to find a niche in the new economy. Enron, however, has traded its way \ninto a starring role, and now it\nhopes it is ready for the movies. \n[BOX] \nTHE PIPELINE OF PLENTY --Natural-gas production --Electric-power generation \n--Enron Online: global-trading\nsystem for 800 commodity products; $120 billion in trades so far in 2000 \n--Enron Energy Services: contracts with\ninstitutional customers to manage all power needs at fixed, long-term prices. \nUltimate aim is control, via the Web,\nof heating, ventilation and air conditioning --Enron Broadband Services: \ntrades bandwidth capacity to fill customers'\ntransmission needs.

{"id": "7375", "contents": "FW: Business Practice #11\nFYI.....\n\nI have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response. \nThere are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term \"take away rights\", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a \"single bus\" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.\nEach participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.\nThe \"single bus\" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.\n\n\"For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission \ninvolved) use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the \nfirst line and the words \"Single Bus\" in the OASIS reservation field and \n\"7-F\" as the Product.\" \nIs this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID \nColumbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C \nare have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a \"TP \nspecific transmission path or designation\".  It was agreed to use \"Single \nBus\" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service \nwhere no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. \nIf the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that \npoint then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for \ntheir transmission portion, but may be \"GF\" or \"No reservation required\" \nfrom the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not \nMIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in? \nMark W.

{"id": "9873", "contents": "Capacity Totals\n\"Kirkpatrick, Joe\" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:\nThe results of the recent capacity auctions would seem to highlight that\nNew York and NYC in particular may not be the \"tight markets\" that\nrequire the numerous layers of mitigation presently in place.\nIt is difficult to determine the \"spare\" capacity in NYC, Long Island or\nthe Rest of State market due the fact that New York unlike other ISOs\ndoes not publish what the total capacity supply is for each month or\nseason. The \"curtailable load\" portion of the equation has had a\nsignificant impact on capacity requirements but as yet it is unknown\nwhat the total impact is. This new capacity supply is effectively\nincreasing the supply of available capacity.\nQuoting generation capabilities and load requirements excludes\ncurtailable load and other demand response mechanisms, the exclusion of\nthese factors grossly misrepresents supply conditions.\nTotal capacity and spare capacity after the completion of all the\ncapacity auctions is information essential to the economics for\ndevelopers who are developing or constructing generation in NYC and\nother areas in NY. There is only a set amount of capacity required in\nNew York and New York City, adjustments in price do not increase demand\nas they would in other commodities.\nAssumptions that supplies are tight and developers can rely on capacity\npayments to contribute to fixed cost recovery are severely overstated.\nThere is a significant surplus of capacity in NYC alone, at a minimum\nthere is well over 800 MW of spare capacity that we can account for as a\nresult of the recent auctions.\nHow much more capacity is out there?\nMarket participants require this information to assess the economics to\ndevelop and build new generation facilities. If capacity payments are\nbeing included in project economics then this will have a significant\nimpact on the viability of projects if those capacity payments are not\nthere.\nThis information needs to be published.\nJoe"}

Franksen \nReal Estate Administration Manager \nUSG Corporation \n(312) 606-4507 \nrfranksen@usg.com \n\nSensitivity:    Confidential \nThis was just forwarded to me by my mom.  You definitely only want to read \nthis one during some quiet time... \n17-year-old Brian Moore had only a short time to write something for the \nFellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. \nIt was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote. \nHe showed the essay, titled \"The Room\" to his mother, Beth, \nbefore he headed out the door. \n\"I wowed 'em.\" he later told his father, Bruce. \n\"It's a killer, It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote.\" \nIt also was the last. \nBrian's parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while \ncleaning out the teenager's locker at Teary Valley High School. \nBrian had been dead only hours, but his parents desperately wanted every \npiece of his life near them -- the crepe paper that had adorned his locker \nduring his senior football season, notes from classmates and teachers, his \nhomework. \nOnly two months before, he had handwritten the essay about encountering \nJesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teen's \nlife. \nBut it was only after Brian's death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized \nthat their son had described his view of heaven. \n\"It makes such an impact that people want to share it. You feel like you \nare there.\" Mr. Moore said. \nBrian Moore died May 27, 1997, -- the day after Memorial Day. \nHe was driving home from a friend's house when his car went off \nBulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole. He emerged \nfrom the wreck unharmed but \nstepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted. \nBrian seemed to excel at everything he did. He was an honor student. He told \nhis parents he loved them \"a hundred times a day\", Mrs. Moore said. He was a \nstar wide receiver for the Teary's Valley \nFootball team and had earned a four-year scholarship to Capital University \nin Columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities. He took it upon \nhimself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at \nschool. \nDuring one homecoming ceremony, Brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl \nhe was escorting wouldn't be embarrassed about being taller than him. \nHe adored his kid brother, Bruce, now 14. \nHe often escorted his grandmother, Evelyn Moore, who lives in Columbus, to \nchurch. \n\"I always called him the \"deep thinker\", Evelyn said of her eldest grandson. \nTwo years after his death, his family still struggles to understand why \nBrian was taken from them. \nThey find comfort at the cemetery where Brian is buried, just a few blocks \nfrom their home. They visit daily. A candle and dozens of silk and real \nflowers keep vigil over the gravesite. \nThe Moore's framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among the family \nportraits in the living room. \n\"I think God used him to make a point. I think we were meant to find it and \nmake something out of it,\" Mrs. Moore said of the essay. \nShe and her husband want to share their son's vision of life after death. \n\"I'm happy for Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see him again \nsomeday.\" Mrs. Moore said. \n\"It just hurts so bad now.\" \nThe Room... \nIn that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found myself in the room. \nThere were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with \nsmall index card files. They were like the ones in libraries that list \ntitles by author or subject in alphabetical order. But these files, which \nstretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction, \nhad very different headings. \nAs I drew near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention was one \nthat read \"Girls I have liked.\" \nI opened it and began flipping through the cards. \nI quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized the names written \non each one. \nAnd then without being told, I knew exactly where I was. \nThis lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my \nlife. \nHere were written the actions of my every moment, big and small, \nin a detail my memory couldn't match. \nA sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred \nwithin me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content. \nSome brought joy and sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so \nintense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching. \nA file named \"Friends\" \nwas next to one marked \n\"Friends I have betrayed.\" \nThe titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird. \n\"Books I Have Read,\" \n\"Lies I Have Told,\" \n\"Comfort I have Given,\" \n\"Jokes I Have Laughed at.\" \nSome were almost hilarious in their exactness: \n\"Things I've yelled at my brothers.\" \nOthers I couldn't laugh at: \n\"Things I Have Done in My Anger\" \n\"Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents.\" \nI never ceased to be surprised by the contents. \nOften there were many more cards than I expected. \nSometimes fewer than I hoped. \nI was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived. \nCould it be possible that I had the time \nin my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards? \nBut each card confirmed this truth. \nEach was written in my own handwriting. \nEach signed with my signature. \nWhen I pulled out the file marked \n\"Songs I have listened to,\" \nI realized the files grew to \ncontain their contents. \nThe cards were packed tightly, \nand yet after two or three yards, \nI hadn't found the end of the file. \nI shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of music \nbut more by the vast time I knew that file represented. \nWhen I came to a file marked \n\"Lustful Thoughts,\" \nI felt a chill run through my body. \nI pulled the file out only an inch, \nnot willing to test its size, \nand drew out a card. \nI shuddered at its detailed content. \nI felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded. \nAn almost animal rage broke on me. \nOne thought dominated my mind: \n\"No one must ever see these cards! \nNo one must ever see this room! \nI have to destroy them!\" \nIn insane frenzy I yanked the file out. \nIts size didn't matter now. \nI had to empty it and burn the cards. \nBut as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor, \nI could not dislodge a single card. \nI became desperate and pulled out a card, \nonly to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it. \nDefeated and utterly helpless, I returned the file to its slot. \nLeaning my forehead against the wall, \nI let out a long, self-pitying sigh. \nAnd then I saw it. \nThe title bore \"People I Have Shared the Gospel With.\" \nThe handle was brighter than those around it, \nnewer, almost unused. \nI pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches \nlong fell into my hands. \nI could count the cards it contained on one hand. \nAnd then the tears came. \nI began to weep. \nSobs so deep that they hurt. \nThey started in my stomach and shook through me. \nI fell on my knees and cried. I cried out of shame, \nfrom the overwhelming shame of it all. \nThe rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. \nNo one must ever, ever know of this room. \nI must lock it up and hide the key. \nBut then as I pushed away the tears, \nI saw Him. \nNo, please not Him. \nNot here. \nOh, anyone but Jesus. \nI watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. \nI couldn't bear to watch His response. \nAnd in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face, \nI saw a sorrow deeper than my own. \nHe seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes. \nWhy did He have to read every one? \nFinally He turned and \nlooked at me from across the room. \nHe looked at me with pity in His eyes. \nBut this was a pity that didn't anger me. \nI dropped my head, \ncovered my face with my hands and began to cry again. \nHe walked over and put His arm around me. \nHe could have said so many things. \nBut He didn't say a word. He just cried with me. \nThen He got up and walked back to the wall of files. \nStarting at one end of the room, He took out a file and, \none by one, began to sign \nHis name over mine on each card. \n\"No!\" \nI shouted rushing to Him. \nAll I could find to say was \n\"No, no, \" \nas I pulled the card from Him. \nHis name shouldn't be on these cards. \nBut there it was, \nwritten in red so rich, \nso dark, \nso alive. \nThe name of Jesus covered mine. \nIt was written with His blood. \nHe gently took the card back. \nHe smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards. \nI don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, \nbut the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk \nback to my side. \nHe placed His hand on my shoulder and said, \n\"It is finished.\" \nI stood up, and He led me out of the room. \nThere was no lock on its door. \nThere were still cards to be written. \n\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" ---Phil. 4:13 \n\"For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, \nthat whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" \nIf you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you \ncan so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also. \nMy \"People I shared the gospel with\" file just got bigger, \nhow about yours? \nA.

{"id": "9417", "contents": "NOx language in Senate Appropriations Legislation\nYesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/Independent \nAgencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislative \nlanguage stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines for \nSIP submission and compliance.   As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Call \nthe courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000, \nand recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans to \nMay 2004.   While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, the \ncourts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federal \nNOx regulation from May of 2003.\nIndustry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislative \nlanguage increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will be \nharmonized.  If the language passes, it will have the force of law -- \ndepending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled to \nharmonize the laws.  On the other hand, this also increases the visibility of \nthe language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in the \nappropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers the \nbill.  The language was not in the House version of the bill, and the \nAdministration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senate \nnegotiators in the end.\nThis would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if this \nlanguage becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sources \nwould not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004.  Right \nnow, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126 \npetitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things.\nWe will keep you posted as developments occur."}

Law school took its toll as did\naccommodating Jo's\nset of friends.  My time had to be split many ways and it\ncan be\ndifficult to juggle everything as I am sure you are all\naware.  But,\nmind you, I was not absent because I didn't care, or found\nsomething\nbetter to do.  It was never because I didn't want to.  At\nthe risk of\nthis becoming even more of a love in, you guys should know,\nas this is\napparently the only opportunity we've taken, you are my\nfriends.  And\nI would like to keep it that way.

The PG&E\nNational Energy Group is not the same company as Pacific Gas and Electric\nCompany, the utility, and is not regulated by the California Public\nUtilities Commission. Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company do not\nhave to buy products or services from the National Energy Group in order to\ncontinue to receive quality regulated services from Pacific Gas and Electric\nCompany.\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 9, 2000--\nAs state swelters through long hot summers, cheap\nhydroelectric power will ensure consumers pay less for electricity\nCiting broad support from a coalition representing consumer advocates,\nbusiness, labor, agriculture and water interests, Pacific Gas and Electric\nCompany jointly filed an agreement with the California Public Utilities\nCommission (CPUC) today to commit the utility's hydroelectric generating\nplants to the effort to help provide needed stability in California's\nfragile electricity market.\nIf approved by the CPUC, this settlement agreement creates a compact between\ncustomer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric Company that would enhance the\neconomic and environmental benefits of the hydroelectric system for the\npublic. The agreement would supersede current plans for auctioning the\nhydroelectric plants to third parties which were filed late last year. The\nagreement calls for PG&E Corporation to retain the hydroelectric generation\nsystem within a California-based affiliate. The other signatories to the\nagreement include The Utility Reform Network (TURN), the Coalition of\nCalifornia Utility Employees (CUE), Agricultural Energy Consumers\nAssociation (AECA), California Retailers Association, Sonoma County Water\nAgency, and Tuolumne Utility District.\n``Parties came together to develop this proposal that will moderate prices,\nand combined with the strong leadership steps taken by Governor Davis last\nweek, will help ensure consumers are protected from the volatility of the\nmarket.'' said Gordon Smith, President and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric\nCompany. ``We are gratified to have the support of large and small consumer\ngroups for this settlement.''\nThe power produced by these hydroelectric facilities will now be committed\nto the market during the periods when the market needs it the most, thereby\nreducing price volatility caused by supply shortages. Additionally, the\nagreement returns 90 percent of any profits from hydroelectric operations to\ncustomers. This sharing of revenues will act as a natural ``hedge'' for\ncustomers against rising energy prices since, as market prices increase, so\nwill payments back to customers under the agreement.\n``A key component of the settlement is a proposed agreement with the\nCalifornia Independent System Operator (CAISO) that assures that power from\nthe hydroelectric assets will not be bid into the energy market in a way\nthat can raise power prices.'' said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN,\nand strong supporter of the proposal.\nThe agreement's key components:\n* Provides a revenue-sharing mechanism that returns 90 percent of profits\nfrom the hydroelectric operations to customers\n* Establishes a market value of $2.8 billion for the hydroelectric system\nthat can be used immediately to pay down ratepayer cost obligations\n* Commits PG&E Corporation to establish a $70 million fund to enhance\nenvironmental quality, water quality, and recreational opportunities\n* Commits PG&E Corporation to donate or protect through conservation\neasements approximately 140,000 acres of watershed lands for public use\n* Honors all existing water agreements with downstream users\n* Protects agricultural uses of the water\n* Ensures the facilities will continue to be operated by a highly qualified\nunion workforce\n``This settlement benefits both California consumers and PG&E's employees,''\nsaid Jack McNally, Business Manager of IBEW 1245. ``Consumers will be\nassured that hydroelectric plants will continue to be operated by the same\ndedicated employees, will continue to provide low cost reliable energy to\nCalifornia consumers, and will continue to be owned by a California company.\nIBEW 1245 represents the union members who operate and maintain the\nhydroelectric system.\n``This agreement represents a fair valuation of the hydroelectric system,''\nsaid Michael Boccadoro, director, Agricultural Energy Consumers Association,\n``this agreement also protects the long-standing beneficial relationship\nbetween the hydro operations and the agricultural users in the state.''\nThe settlement agreement filed at the CPUC will be subject to public\nhearings and review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\nInterested parties will be able to provide comment prior to any CPUC\ndecision. Also, the hydroelectric system transfer requires approval from the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\n``The CEQA review process itself will ensure that there are no significant\nenvironmental impacts as a result of this transfer,'' said Gordon Smith.\n``In addition, keeping the hydroelectric facilities and associated watershed\nlands together protects the public interest in these assets.''\nThe system includes 174 dams, 68 powerhouses, 360 miles of canals, tunnels,\nand flumes, and approximately 140,000 acres of watershed land. The\nhydroelectric system has a capacity of 3,896 megawatts, and provides a\nclean, renewable, low-cost source of electricity particularly during periods\nof high demand. The system currently delivers about 5 percent of\nCalifornia's yearly electricity needs, and up to 10% of the State's\nelectricity demand during hot, summer days.\n``We have enjoyed a positive working relationship with the folks at PG&E for\nmany years,'' said Tim McCullough, manager of the Tuolumne Utilities\nDistrict. ``This agreement ensures the water resource will continue to be\nmanaged in a way that protects the interests of Tuolumne County residents.''\nThis agreement differs substantially from the transfer contemplated through\nlegislation at the end of August last year. The 1999 Legislative proposal\ndid not include the price stabilizing revenue sharing mechanism. Although\nthe 1999 legislative package ultimately failed to achieve consensus because\nof the immense complexities of balancing interests through legislative\ncompromise, this year's regulatory filing fulfills the directives of the\n1996 restructuring legislation and provides the kind of public and state\nenvironmental review that will forge consensus.\nPG&E Corporation, with 1999 operating revenues of almost $21 billion and\noperations in 21 states, markets energy services and products throughout\nNorth America through its National Energy Group. PG&E Corporation's\nbusinesses also include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the Northern and\nCentral California utility that delivers natural gas and electricity to one\nin every 20 Americans."}

Seller agrees to\nprovide Purchaser with an original tax receipt, in Seller's name, indicating\nremittance by the Purchaser of the amounts withheld.

The \nENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need \ninserted.THANKS\nJackie Young\n12/15/2000 11:32 AM\n\nSherlyn, I've placed the correct volumes for days 6 and 9 for ENA.  I'll have \nthe deal extended for Dynegy and let you know when it's done.\nVictor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh \nand by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the \ne-mail on yesterday.  Sorry.  I thought that I knew you.

I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out \nthere, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The \ntrack id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece \nuntil I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is \nextended for days 10/6 and 10/19.\nJackie Young\n12/15/2000 10:51 AM\n\nArre you saying that for both days that two (2) ENA contracts should be \nplaced at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the \ntotal volume to each contract?\n\nJackie,\nYou did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave \nyou was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the \npurchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, \nthat is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the \ninterconnect report.\nJackie Young\n12/15/2000 10:30 AM\n\nLenart/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nAccounting arrangement has been placed.

I have created an accounting arrangement for \nthese days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA \nportion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase \nfrom Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting \narrangement.

The design was tentatively approved last month, subject to final\nreview.  The following revised provision should serve you well in the\nmeantime:\nAll-Employee Stock Option Program\nEnron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time\nregular employees in designated domestic and international locations through\nthe All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made\nunder this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The\ngrants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or\na pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  Subject to final approval by the\nEnron Corp. board of directors, a one time award of non-qualified stock\noptions under a replacement program is proposed to be made to eligible\nemployees as of December 29, 2000, in value equal to 25% of annual base\nsalary (5% of annual base salary for a 5-year period; salary valuation and\nvalue may vary in some international locations).  Program awards are subject\nto and effective upon the approval by the Compensation and Management\nDevelopment Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock\nawards will be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as\ndetermined by the Committee.  The exercise price for grants of stock options\nwill be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which\nthe award is granted.  The program may or may not be offered in certain\ndomestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or\nlocal labor and employment laws."}

The layoffs hit Relera&#39;s offices in Denver and San Diego. And optical components manufacturer, Zenastra Photonics, cut 160 positions.

Just $2.99 per order.\nhttp://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=168091\nASK THE FOOL\n-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?\n-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to\ninvesting and for those trying out new investing methods. You\nsimply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short\nof actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some\ncompanies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a\npretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites\noffer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep\ntrack of details such as when you \"bought\" the shares and at\nwhat price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the\nmarket.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=168092\n-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's\n(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what\nother indexes are out there.\n-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a\nparticular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The\nmost famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which\nincludes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,\nMerck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on\nlarge companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.\nThe Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.\ncompanies based on market capitalization (current share price\nmultiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000\nconstitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of\nsmall-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of\nthe 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire\n5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It\nbegan with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.\nThere are many more indexes. Some are for international regions\nsuch as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors\nsuch as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried\nchicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)\nGot some questions of your own for the Fool? Head to our Help\narea or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question\ndiscussion board.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=168093\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=168094\n_________________________________________________________________\nINVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES\nIn order to help readers find books that offer valuable business\ninsights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly\nbook award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner\nof the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, \"Rules for\nRevolutionaries\" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some\nbold guidelines for those who want to bring about business\nrevolutions. Here are a few:\nhttp://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=168095\n1. \"Don't worry, be crappy.\" Yes, you read that right. It's\nKawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take\nalmost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to\nrelease a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving\nits next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh\ncomputer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect\nconfiguration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no\ndocumentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would\nhave meant giving the competition an edge and losing the\nconfidence of software developers.\n2. \"Eat your own dog food.\" This sounds crazy, but think about\nit. By using your own company's products or services, you'll\nunderstand what the customer experience is like and you'll be\nable to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who\nbuilt Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food\n(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.\nKawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a\nshaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven\nand test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,\nbicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to\ncommute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on\nproducts.\n3. \"Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant.\" (Really, we're not\nmaking this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50\npercent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165\npounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much\ninformation as you can find and then share it.\nIf you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you\nstay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on\npersonal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award\nwinners.

{"id": "4112", "contents": "FW: The Well Mannered Arkansan\nMartha Stewart's Tips for Arkansans\nGENERAL:\n1. Never take a beer to a job interview\n2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.\n3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.\n4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.\n5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is\nstill considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.\nDINING OUT:\n1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt the\npaper cup and pour slowly so as not to \"bruise\" the fruit of the vine.\n2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.\nENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:\n1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared\nby a taxidermist.\n2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good\nhis manners are.\nPERSONAL HYGIENE:\n1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that\nshould done in private, using one's OWN truck keys.\n2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.\n3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.\n4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend\nto detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.\nDATING (Outside the Family):\n1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.\n2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: \"I've been wanting to\ngo out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago\".\n3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back.\nSome will say 10:00 PM., others might say \"Monday.\" If the latter is\nthe answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.\nTHEATER ETIQUETTE:\n1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up\nimmediately after the movie has ended.\n2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have\nproven they can't hear you.\nWEDDINGS:\n1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.\n2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.\n3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund\nand a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.\n4. Though uncomfortable, say \"yes\" to socks and shoes for that\nspecial occasion.\nDRIVING ETIQUETTE:\n1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun\nis loaded and the deer is in sight.\n2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest\ntires does not always have the right of way.\n3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.\n4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is\nimpolite to ask her to bring back beer too."}

Michelle will bring me up-to-date.

Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) \nreported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's \nletter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to \nsign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There \nare initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows \nwhose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it \nis not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask \nour Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  \nKeep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, \nElectronorte. \n2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the \nambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, \nWinston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political \navenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, \nhowever, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek \nassistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political \nbattle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to \nseek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to \nprogress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has \nexpired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong \nmessage and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we \nproceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 \nof the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at \nthe end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little \ntime, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate \nproceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what \nreaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure \nhow that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the \ncommercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure \nwhat rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may \naffect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look \nat under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or \nexpress waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would \nadvise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with \nrespect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand \nevery possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix \ndeveloped already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own \nway.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have \ntraditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who \nrepresents them. \n3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE \ndoes not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the \ncontract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm \ntold we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that \nwe were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine \nPowell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our \nforce majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our \nposition.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both \nparties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  \nI'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.\n4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration \nconcern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what \nit will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. \nDarren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to \nconsider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of \nproposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a \nnumber to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It \nneeds to be subject to review as we go along.\n5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going \nto get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and \nget a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best \nadvice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the \nBrazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so \nI am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in \nthe court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position \nthat we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.\nPlease give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. \nJohn Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I \nmay be unaware of with any strategic plan.\nRegards,\nMichelle"}

GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A\nBREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT\nCLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION\n(28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST\nTHE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH\nRELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED\nDISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.]\nSIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL\nCLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE\nIS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO\nCONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH\nCONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.\nI CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT\nBONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION\nACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE\nADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF\nCOMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED\nWITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:\n\"SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5\nU.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE\nSECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS,\nBONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS\nAND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT\nPROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY\nENRON.

I also have your printer sitting on a chair in my office..\n\nJean,\nI'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an \"image builder\" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.\nAnyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).\nSo my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?\nthanks,\nKevin\nx35559"}

{"id": "3509", "contents": "RE: Fehr Option Agreement\nI spoke to Don Shindler about your comments.  We will hold the contract and\nany discussions with the Seller's attorney pending your approval following\ndiscussions with your Accounting Department.  As per Rusty's email, we will\nprovide for a 12 month post-expiration/termination extended triggering\nperiod.  As to the specific performance issue, we have agreed to this in the\npast after the exercise of the option in the event the ENA entity was in\ndefault of its obligation to acquire the property.  The alternative seems to\nbe to provide for some additional payment as liquidated damages for a\nfailure to close over and above the option consideration.  Re:  the zoning\nissue.  Fred:  if there is any thought to using the Fehr property as a\nlaydown construction site or other use, we will need to address this issue.\nLet's discuss.  Please let us know how you would like us to handle this.  To\ndiscuss, please call me or Don.  Thanks.\nKaren S. Way\nPiper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe\n203 N. LaSalle\nChicago, Illinois 60601\nemail:  karen.way@piperrudnick.com\n(ph) 312-368-2152\n(fax) 312-630-6347\n\nHere are my observations:\nI agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second,\nthere has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we\nwant\nto have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still\nneeds to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no\nmatter what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty\nsuggested, it should be limited to x months after the expiration of the\noption agreement.  We'll need to run this back through Accounting.\nI really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we\nadd\nthe language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back\nthrough Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.\nI don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this\nparcel.\nKay\nRusty Stevens\n09/14/2000 04:45 PM\n\nI am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In\nreviewing them, I have the following comments:\nThe paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land\nupon a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is\na put option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.\nWe carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.\nAlso, how can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I\nthink we would need to say that \"if we decide to build the plant after\nthe option period expires, then that would serve to extend the term of\nthis agreement, however, if the option agreement expires unexercised\nfor\na one year period then we won't be bound to the deal.\nIf the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another\nsimilar paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but\n\"specific performance\" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.\nLets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as\nleverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good\nto\ngo on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if\nwe could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.\nSince we were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the\ndelay\nto end of next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing\nsmoke on the extra $10,000.\nFred :  Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment\ncheck ?\n____________________________________________________________________________\nThe e-mail address and domain name of the sender changed on November 1, \n1999.

Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.\"  pp 20-21"}

I look forward to great success in the next year.\nFrevert, Whalley, Lavo and myself are sitting down to discuss Electrobolt on \nTuesday morning - subject to that meeting we have approval to go ahead from \nSkilling.  \nRegards\nDelainey\n---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 12/08/2000 \n12:25 PM ---------------------------\n\n12/07/2000 11:53 PM\nSent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON\n\nOn November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, \nannouncing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide \noperations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that \nare underway to restructure  Enron\u0001,s operations in South America.  The basic \norganizational framework has been set. \nAs you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new \nresponsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and \nJoe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting \nto Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; \nhowever, Orlando\u0001,s focus will be on direct sales origination, \ncommercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe\u0001,s focus will \nbe on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall \ncountry management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO \nof Elektro until its ultimate sale.\nThe existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding \nElektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in \nEnron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark \nFrevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and \nArgentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our \nreputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being \nmanaged prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets \nare pursued.\nThe remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South \nAmerica will be organized around the highly successful North American network \nbusiness model.  This model employs people, market making, physical \ncommodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value \nproducts to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and \nenjoys high rates of return on invested capital.\nIn the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to \nJoe and Orlando:\nThe Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  \nfocus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine \nnatural gas and electricity, with the following goals:\n? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services \nneeded by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital \ncapabilities;\n? Providing those products and services across South America and across the \nvalue chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value \nopportunity;\n? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move \nquickly to capitalize;\n? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the \noverall risk of the organization;\n? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America \nconsistent with this strategy, and\n? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal \nflow.\nThe Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who \nwork as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, \ncapital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, \nfinance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. \nThe Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The \nteam will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book \nfor the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales \nefforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively \ntrading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible \nfor managing Enron South America\u0001,s overall risk and will have a direct \nreporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas \nrisk activities.\nThe Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American \nCommercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we \nwill continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  \nThe goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization \nthat is very market and commercially focused.  The following support \nfunctions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team \nand will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in \nHouston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business \nunits have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as \nwell as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston \ninfrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements \nin South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.\nThese groups include:\nThe Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will \nmanage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as \ngovernmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, \nin the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a \nfunctioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will \nassume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this \ninterim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory \nfunction.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick \nShapiro in Enron Government Affairs.\nThe Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the \ninterface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his \ncurrent duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will \nalso report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be \nassisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the \nCuiaba project.\nThe Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and \nJohn Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America\u0001,s legal \nrequirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron \nWholesale Services - Legal Department.\nMiguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information \nTechnology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will \nreport to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial \nfunctions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting \nrelationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron \nWholesale Services \u0001) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale \nServices \u0001) Business Analysis and Reporting.\nThese changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and \nreflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our \nfinancial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new \norganizational structure and the near term potential for business in the \nregion, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly \naffected will be notified shortly.\nEnron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its \nbusinesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are \nuniquely positioned to leverage Enron\u0001,s core capabilities and create \nshareholder value."}

My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.\nI only considered CR \"Recomended \" cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.\nDad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.

{"id": "3317", "contents": "Re: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel\nIs this still an active case? If so, I'd like to get  a status report. Who is \nhandling(inside and outside)\nRichard B Sanders\n01/21/2001 10:23 AM\n\n----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 01/21/2001 10:27 AM -----\nPeter Keohane\n12/19/2000 10:09 PM\n\nJim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to \ninform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The \nlitigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their \nshareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny \nfor Canadian Enerdata.\nIt is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas \ntrading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron \nOnline, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas \nindices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a \ncomprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad \nmarket.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two \ndays' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to \nEnerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for \nthe indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is \nthe indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and \ntherefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and \nthousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent \nonly NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility \nand unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability \nto trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or \nelectronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody \nbought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke \ncan, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of \ncontracts to buy and sell Coke.]\nIn any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to \ncommence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, \ninterference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, \ncivil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to \nprove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided \nnot to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process \nwill be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all \nelectronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The \nlawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and \ndamages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as \nusual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get \ninvolved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the \nrest of the market.\nIn terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake \nCassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was \nconflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find \nreplacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes \nbut based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of \nMacleod Dixon.\nMy apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter \nwith Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and \nRichard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, \nplease call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the \nholidays.\nPeter."}

{"id": "828", "contents": "RE: Dow Invoice\nthanks\n\nBridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier.\n\nWe need to figure out how to play this out ASAP so that we know how much cash needs to be sent out.  My guess is that we would prefer to have Bridgeline pay Dow directly.  I have a voicemail from the guy at Dow and would like to get back with him on our plan.  Let me know.  Thanks.\nStuart\n\nBrian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues.\n\nWho keeps the books for Bridgeline?  In other words, how can we find out if they have paid their $1,000,000?  Please let me know.\n\nI have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following\n1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000\n3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.\nSection 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.\n2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40\nFinal Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)\nSection 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.\n3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500\nI find no basis for this in the contract.\nUnder Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  \nLet me know if you have any questions."}

What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?\n(e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade)\nOC3  --> OC12\nOC3  --> OC48\nOC12 --> OC48\n5.

The Teabagging\nThe all time classic maneuver of tapping your cock on a chick's\nforehead whilst she is sucking on your balls, and uttering the\ntimeless\nphrase -- \"Who's Your daddy?\"\n2. The Houdini\nGoing at it doggy-style until you are just about to come, then\npull out and spit on her back so she thinks that you have. When\nshe\nturns\naround a blast is unleashed into her face and she is left\nshocked\nand\namazed, wondering how you managed it.\n3. The Angry Dragon\nImmediately after you blow your load in a girl's mouth, smack\nthe\nback of her head and make it come out her nose. When she gets\nup,\nshe'll\nlook like an angry dragon.\n4. Cum Guzzling Sperm Burping Bitch\nThe once in a lifetime act of blowing a hot steamy load down the\nback of a girl's throat and then proceeding to give her a large\ncold\nbottle\nof your favorite carbonated drink, making her guzzle it down.\nThen,\nshake\nher head vigorously back and forth to create the Cum Guzzling,\nSperm\nBurping effect. A great way to impress your friends.\n5. Dirty Sanchez\nA time honored event in which while laying the bone doggy-style,\nyou insert your finger into her asshole. You then pull it out\nand\nwipe\nit across her upper lip, leaving a thin shit mustache. This\nmakes\nher\nlook\nlike someone whose name is Dirty Sanchez.\n6. The Donkey Punch\nBanging a girl doggy style and then moments before you cum, you\nstick your dick in her ass and then punch her in the back of the\nneck.\nThe blow to the neck will stun the muscles in the female's ass,\nwhich\nwill\nconstrict the penis and give you a tremendous orgasmic\nexperience\nwhen\nyou\nejaculate.\n7. The Flaming Amazon\nThis one's for all you pyromaniacs out there. When you're\nscrewing some chick, right when your about to cum, pull out\nand quickly grab the nearest lighter and set her pubes on fire,\nthen...extinguish the flames with your jizz!\n8. The Flying Camel\nA personal favorite. As she is lying on her back and you are\nhammering her on your knees, you very carefully move forward and\nprop\nyourself (without using your arms) on your dick while it is\nstill\ninserted\nin her vertical seafood taco. You then proceed to flap your arms\nand\nlet\nout a long shrieking howl, much like a flying camel. Strictly a\nclassy\nmove.\n9. The Screwnicorn\nWhen a dyke puts her strap-on dildo on her forehead and proceeds\nto go at her partner like a crazed unicorn.\n10. The Zombie Mask\nWhile getting head from your favorite, unsuspecting,\ntrash-barrel\nwhore, tell her you want her to look right up at you with those\n\"pretty\nlittle eyes\" when you blow your load. Then, just when you're\nready\nto\nspew a good weeks worth of goo, blast that hefty load in both\neyes.\nThis\ntemporary state of blindness will produce the zombie effect as\nshe\nstumbles around the room with arms outstretched, and moaning\nlike\nthe walking dead.\n_______________________________________________________\nSend a cool gift with your E-Card\nhttp://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/"}

This is the first I've ever \nseen or heard that this was a \"condition to closing.\"  \nDan/Rob - is this true?  \nTo me the cost is irrelevant since Jerrel is the only Director affected and \nbecause of his actions (and/or lack thereof) the company can't afford to \ncover him.  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Randal Maffett/HOU/ECT on 06/08/2000 \n06:38 PM ---------------------------\nJerrel Branson <jerrel@ecogas.com> on 06/08/2000 05:16:24 PM\n\nAnswering backwards - D&O insurance is exceedingly expensive for small firms\nto secure, thus most do without it.  Second, it was a condition when we\nclosed and McConville/Lambert, et al researched it through Enron Risk\nManagement, Don Marshall, and stated that it was in place automatically for\nany majority owned merchant investment.  A confirmation letter was promised\non 14 July and when pressed in September Lambert finally got around to\nissuing the letter to Carl and me that I mentioned earlier.\nJerrel\n\nI'm not very experienced in these matters so I'm checking with the folks\nhere.  Can you explain why Enron should cover non-Enron directors?  Why\ndoesn't Ecogas have its own insurance?  Any help you can provide is\nappreciated."}

Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective. \nThe bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.\nThough there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.\nInformation we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.\nEnron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.\nThe \"Dunn Investigation\":\nDunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.\nThe report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron \"complies.\"\nDunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.\nIn response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.\nShe was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th.\nIf the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.\nThe budget:\nThe Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.\nThe Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.\nThat leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.\nThe Assembly\nIn short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.  \nThe Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.\nUnable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened. \nIt has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.\nThe Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.\nBest information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.\nLate Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.\nEnron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.\nBest,\nJeff"}

It \nwas the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap \non wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- \nsoaring total power costs.\nThe move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power \nmarket after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In \nother deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped \nat $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent \nmarket abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new \nplants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because \nutilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but \nweren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other \nmarkets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on \nthe spot market, where most power trades. \nDuring the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale \nelectricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a \nyear earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained \nabove $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those \npower purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per \nmegawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for \nthat power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. \nCalifornia utilities buy the power used by their customers from the \nstate-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, \nthe California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, \nless than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities \nthere were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities \nweren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of \n13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members \nrepresenting consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & \nElectric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big \ninvestor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this \nyear. \nSome ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet \ndown price caps. \"We're going after the windfall profits,\" said S. David \nFreeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, \nwho voted for the measure. \"What we've got now is a market accustomed to \nripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on.\" \nBut other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even \nworse. \"The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,\" said Pam \nPrairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State \nUniversity in East Lansing. \"But there's a real danger you'll set prices too \nlow and make your supply problems even worse.\" \nOther economists agreed. \"At best, this is poorly administered cost-based \nregulation,\" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University \nwho sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. \"At worst, \nit creates all sorts of perverse market incentives.\" \nFor example, it may increase the problem of \"megawatt laundering\" on hot days \nin which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then \nsell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it \ncould encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather \nthan where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In \nthe end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened \ntransmission system. \nIn fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward \nelectricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for \npower they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as \n1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. \n\"This decision shows the height of lunacy,\" said Rick Shapiro, a managing \ndirector at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro \nsaid Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. \nIt is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is \nexpected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's \nmarket structure. That order will include its determination of the \neffectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the \ngovernance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. \nRecently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the \nbusiness interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to \nCalifornia residents. \nThe most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of \nexecutives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO \nChief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't \ntake into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. \nWinter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to \nneighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically \ninterconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase \nthe highest prices. \n\"We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,\" Mr. Winter \nsaid. \"Then along comes this proposal\" with caps that would adjust repeatedly \nthroughout the day, depending on demand.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

While nearly double the stock's value prior to the \noffer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix \nmade its debut in 1999.\nAn Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet \ndecided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the \ncompany private would \"give us more opportunity to directly affect our \ninvestment.\" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, \nAzurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. \nAzurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron \nhad done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading \nskills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But \nAzurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business \nand government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, \nwere slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, \naccustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the \ncapital-intensive water business. \nThe company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's \ninternational division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron \nexecutives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief \nexecutive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the \ncompany's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was \nbelieved to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, \nherself. She declined a request for an interview. \nIn its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four \noffers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which \ncame from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a \nlengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by \nAzurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities \nlitigation. \nIn its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded \"that \nthere is no other buyer willing to pay the $7\" and so proceeded with its own \noffer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a \nbetter deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that \nAzurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but \nsaid they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron, which has \nbeen frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday \nthat public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix \nstock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the \nsuggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its \ndebut in 1999.

All Rights Reserved. \nBusiness\nWessex switch likely\nAdam Jones in New York\n10/28/2000\nThe Times of London\nNews International\n2W\n64\n(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000)\nWessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a \ndisastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. \nWessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by \nAzurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's \nexpertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, \nsince listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into \nfreefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because \nit drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities.\nIt emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that \nis Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to \nlend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held \nshares, thereby taking it private. \nThe Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - \n63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex \nWater if it went private.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \nBUSINESS\nEnron water unit could go private under loan plan\nNELSON ANTOSH\nStaff\n10/28/2000\nHouston Chronicle\n3 STAR\n1\n(Copyright 2000)\nEnron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about \n$275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that \nare publicly traded. \nThe deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about \ndouble what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for \nAzurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public \nin June 1999.\nThe maneuver technically can be called a \"take-under,\" said analyst Carol \nCoale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's \nleast painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up \nits ambitious plans. \n\"Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,\" said Coale. \n\"This is a solution to a problem.\" \nAzurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's \nproposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the \nproposal's structure had not been outlined. \nEnron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to \nwithdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and \nemployees deteriorated. \nOne of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the \nbuyout. \nThe deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns \na third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which \nEnron owns a 50 percent voting interest. \nThe proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the \nmarket price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. \nThe common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at \n$6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. \nBecoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility \nin restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and \nadministrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign \ncompetition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost \nstructure has been its primary problem, she said. \nAzurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new \npresident and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date \nthat Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief \nexecutive. \nEnron and Azurix have been looking at \"strategic alternatives\" for nine \nmonths, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate \ndevelopment, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. \nOne alternative was selling the company, he said. \nThat didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 \nper share. \nThe fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said \nMeets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity \nof the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities \nlitigation. \n\"We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,\" \nMeets said in the letter. \"However, we strongly believe that there is no \nother buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later \nwithdrawn) by the fourth bidder.\"\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in \nstate government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House \nposts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes \npresident. \nAsked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the \nappointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion \nindicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds.\nNear the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. \nAnd though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House \ntransition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush \nheadquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between \nlooking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. \nThe candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of \ntransition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks \nbackward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his \nrunning mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up \nin his administration. \nThe transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush \nfriend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial \nappointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has \nbeen interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks \nwho are interested in serving in a Bush administration. \nJohnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went \nwell and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing \nadministrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were \nousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that \ncan make the mistakes, he said. \nThere is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in \nAugust, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition \nhandbook titled \"The Keys to a Successful Presidency.\" \n\"Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would \ndiscourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start \nplanning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the \nscenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next \n70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between \nthe election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial \nsuccess or failure of the next administration,\" Herbert Berkowitz, a \nfoundation vice president, said in releasing the study. \nAll indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with \nJohnson at the helm. \nJohnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be \noverloaded with Texans. \n\"It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,\" he said. \nDespite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered \nshoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. \nJohnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early \nspeculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for \nhead of personnel at the White House. \nKaren Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial \ncampaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White \nHouse. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, \nthough he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the \nRepublican National Committee. \nNot as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the \n\"iron triangle\" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have \nbeen on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager \nof the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the \ngovernor's office. \nCapitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House \npost, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of \nstaff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the \nmegasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. \nHowever, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's \nlegislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. \nIn addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has \nsparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. \nConstitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on \nJan. 20. \nMuch more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, \nperhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. \nThat could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the \nGovernor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a \nhome under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also \nhas a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. \nNot out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. \nGov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the \nGovernor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. \nIf the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor \ncomplicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's \noffice a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After \nall, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial \ninauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. \nNo matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford \nranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet \nmembers. \nYou may contact Ken Herman at kherman@statesman.com or 445-1718. \nWashington buzz A look at Bush allies expected to get appointments in a Bush \nadministration: * Texas Secretary of State Elton Bomer * State Rep.

Williams\n10/27/2000\nDow Jones News Service\n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \nNew York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy \ntrading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company \nprivate in a $7-a-share buyout.\nFilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made \nthe proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four \nthird parties for its stake in Azurix. \nIn a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential \nbuyers \"were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market \nprice of approximately $4 a share.\" \nEnron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share \noffer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. \"The reasons given \nby the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital \nstructure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities \nlitigation,\" the letter said. \nMark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether \nEnron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with \nother parties regarding its Azurix stake. \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to \n$6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 \nshares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, \ncompared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. \nIn the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial \nand full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned \nupon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. \n\"Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's \nshareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these \noptions almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater \nreturn to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,\" the letter said. \nEnron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other \n\"deal protection devices.\" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition \nthat \"might provide greater value\" to shareholders. \nDaine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is \nnow entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the \ninformation contained in Enron's filing. \"The historical information in the \nfiling is factually correct,\" she told Dow Jones Newswires. \nShe said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. \nIn the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position \nwith customers and employees may deteriorate further. \"We must therefore \nreserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,\" Enron's letter said. \nIn the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two \n\"internationally recognized investment bankers\" early this year to evaluate \nstrategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to \nunrelated third parties. \nEnron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a \nshare for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. \"We believe it is in Azurix's \nbest interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and \nemployees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,\" Enron said. \n-By Christopher C.

Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of \nany decision was unclear. \nEnron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled \nHouston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. \nThe buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at \nAzurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price \nof $19 per share. \nBut a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and \nempty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, \nwhose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around \nthe $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive \nofficer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. \nEnron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying \nits stake in Azurix. \nWhile three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price \nof about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per \nshare (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined \nto pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining \nthe buyout proposal. \n\"We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public \nstockholders,\" the letter stated. \"Our proposed transaction would permit \nAzurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their \nshares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have \ntraded in several months.\" \nAnalysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 \nper shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that \nAzurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic \nof the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. \nEnron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 \nto close at $6.56."}

Please rebook the trades, changing both the tick size and the cap amount, to reflect the above allocations.

ADRD legal counsel has apparently discussed this with the \nRegistrar of Regulations and it is not expected that there will be any \nproblem.  Larry may have to have a discussion on Monday morning directly with \nthe Registrar to answer questions respecting why this is necessary and what \nit needs to be done on an expedited basis.  Apparently, even expedited it \nwill take a week for the registration process such that the ADRD intends to \nsend a notice to all bidders on Monday that it has received approval for the \nPPAs to be registered as a regulation and that such registration will not \nlikely be effective after the PPA auction has commenced. \n2) He has spoken with the Executive Director of the AEUB, Bob Heggie, who has \nindicated that he intends to recommend to the Chairman of the AEUB on Monday \nmorning that the AEUB issue an AEUB Order accepting the 26 \nerrata/clarifications identified by PWC on June 2000 and the subsequent \nerrata/clarifications that have been identified since.  Apparently PWC will \nhave this letter done on Monday and I expect it will include the FRDT and \nPRDT issue.\nI believe all of the following outstanding errata/clarifications have now \nbeen addressed to Enron's satisfaction:\n(a) NPV in the RBPA;\n(b) parasitic load\n(c) change in law - more profitable\n(d) clarification of FCR\n(e) FRDT and PRDT (Article C7).\nRegards,\nRob"}

Note that the\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\nstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\nof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\nAlso, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\nare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.

If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know\nso that we can stop this process.\nComments on the Draft Schedule:\n1.  Part 1(a) \"Specified Entity\":  A Specified Entity is an entity\nother than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a\ntermination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified\nEntity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a\nSpecified Entity with respect to TBS.\n2.  Part 1(b) \"Threshold Amount\": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which\nseems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.\n3.  Part 1(h) \"Additional Event of Default\":  If we use a swap\narrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one\nfor 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want\nan additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest\nin TBS could result in termination?\n4.  Part 2  \"Representations\":  I think that we need someone in tax\nto determine whether TBS can make the representations.\n5.  Part 4(d) & (e) \"Credit Support Provider\": Shell will be the\ncredit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.\n6.  Part 4(g) \"Governing Law\", 4(h) \"Arbitration\": The schedule\nproposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem\nto me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to\nthose in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,\nunder New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of\nthe gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).\nComment on the Proposed Confirmation:\nI have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas\nSupply Agreement under the \"Fixed Amount Details\" but have not done so under\nthe \"Floating Amount Details\", which cross-references the provisions of the\nSCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.\nPlease let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments\nor any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to\ndiscuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to\ncompletion.\nRegards, Dean\n<<SWAPCON1.doc>>\n- SWAPCON1.doc"}

This guy needs to be a Bus\th\n speech writer.\nThis was written by Miami-Herald Columnist Leonard Pitts, an African\nAmerican)\n_______\nWe'll go forward from this moment\nby Leonard Pitts\nIt's my job to have something to say.\nThey pay me to provide words that help make sense of\nthat which troubles the American soul. But in this\nmoment of airless shock when hot tears sting\ndisbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say,\nthe only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to\nthe unknown author of this suffering.\nYou monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.\nWhat lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's\nattack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?\nWhat was it you hoped we would learn?  Whatever it\nwas, please know that you failed.\nDid you want us to respect your cause? You just damned\nyour cause.\nDid you want to make us fear? You just steeled our\nresolve.\nDid you want to tear us apart? You just brought us\ntogether.\nLet me tell you about my people. We are a vast and\nquarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social,\npolitical and class division, but a family\nnonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of\nexpending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural\nminutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball\nteam's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy,\ntoo, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and\nmaterial goods, and maybe because of that, we\nwalk through life with a certain sense of blithe\nentitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though --\npeace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know\nthe right thing and to do it. And we are, the\noverwhelming majority of us, people of faith,\nbelievers in a just and loving God.\nSome people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all\nof this makes us weak.  You're mistaken. We are not\nweak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot\nbe measured by arsenals.\nIN PAIN\nYes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are\nin shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of\nthe awful thing you did, still working to make\nourselves understand that this isn't a special effect\nfrom some  Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot\ndevelopment from a Tom Clancy novel.\nBoth in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and\nthe probable final death toll, your attacks are likely\nto go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the\nhistory of the United States and, probably, the\nhistory of the world.\nYou've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied\nbefore.\nBut there's a gulf of difference between making us\nbloody and making us fall.\nThis is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter\nsorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last\ntime anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental\npain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage,\nterrible in our force.\nWhen provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear\nany suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the\npursuit of justice.\nI tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know\nmy people, as you, I think, do not. What I know\nreassures me. It also causes me to tremble with\ndread of the future.\nIn the days to come, there will be recrimination and\naccusation, fingers pointing to determine whose\nfailure allowed this to happen and what can be\ndone to prevent it from happening again. There will be\nheightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic\nfreedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,\nchastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably\ndetermined.\nTHE STEEL IN US\nYou see, the steel in us is not always readily\napparent. That aspect of our character is seldom\nunderstood by people who don't know us well. On\nthis day, the family's bickering is put on hold.\nAs Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn,\nand as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that\nwe cherish.\nSo I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It\noccurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the\ndepths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider\nthe message received. And take this message in\nexchange: You don't know my people. You don't know\nwhat we're capable of. You don't know what you\njust started. But you're about to learn."}

{"id": "1599", "contents": "RE: Well-Designed RTO\nI am beginning to agree with Dave on Governance - that a for-profit TransCo may not be in our best interest.  Let's talk about how to change the wording.\nJim\n\nJanel,\nThe paper is OK.\nMy only comments would be, as far as an RTO offer non-discriminatory access to transmission, I think without the word \"comparable\" the Participating Transmission Owners (PTOs) of the proposed westConnect would say, yes, they offer non-discriminatory access...to whatever is left over after they distribute the majority of the rights to the incumbants!  Is that comparable, in my opinion no, which is one of the reasons why I inserted the word comparable.  I can see where that may be nit-picking, but that was my reason for adding it.\nAs far as my comment about Governance.  The governance of WestConnect, a for-profit TransCo, is severely biased to the favor of the PTOs.  Perhaps it is just their version of a for-profit Transco that is not favorable to other market-participants, but I would be cautious in citing a for-profit RTO as a preferred model, a for-profit Transco operating within a non-profit - Independent RTO, seems to be a more reasonable.  But these judgements are based on my understanding of the WestConnect.\nKind Regards,\nDave \n\nJim, Dave and Steve - \nThank you very much for the feedback and edits to the Well-Designed RTO paper.  I've made the bulk of the changes you suggested except for the section on page 1 - Which constitutes a well-designed institutional structure for an RTO?\nEach of you had significant issues with this section.  I get the feeling that we should eliminate it altogether but want to clear that with you before I do so.  Do you have alternative suggestions?  \nOther than that particular section, I would really appreciate if you reviewed the attached one more time (with the changes that were made) and let me know if you are comfortable with how it is evolving.\nthank you."}

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  \nAside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.\nCongratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.\nEnron in the Middle East \nEnron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.\nEnron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.\nDevelopment of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast\nAn important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German\nborder was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. \nEnron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!\nLEGAL STUFF\nThe information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietary to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries.

{"id": "1330", "contents": "devaluation and lm curve\nFor those who attended section I promised to clarify whether the LM\nneeded to shift if a country on fixed exchange rates chose to devalue\nwhen suddenly facing a higher risk premium.\nBecause of the risk premium and the outflow of capital at the prevailing\ninterest rate, r*, the absence of any central bank action combined with\nallowing the exchange rate to float, automatically lowers the exchange\nrate.  So no shift of the LM curve is required.\nBasically the demand for assets denominated in the currency has declined\nthereby putting downward pressure on the currency. The decision to float\nthe exchange rate \"accomodates\" this decline in demand and the central\nbank does not need to increase money supply to cause the devaluation, it\nhappens on its own.\nOf course, the new exchange rate should be pegged at the level where\nr=r* + theta.  Now in the future, the central bank will do whatever is\nrequired to keep the exchange rate at the new level.\nFor those who don't follow this, don't worry it is a fairly technical\npoint, but I wanted to make sure I clarified it.\nbhash"}

She said that she would not be available to meet formally until Monday due to the declared disaster at their operations due to the flood.  She said they are moving back to the Pennzoil building today and Friday, so things should be close to normal by Monday.\nPat said that it is not be a problem to export the MV90 data (in just about any format) on a daily basis for us.  The data is housed in MV90 databases which , according to Pat, can only be read by an MV90 system; so we would need to purchase MV90 (very expensive) if we wanted to read the data directly.  \nI suggest we get the data exported daily from CSC to an FTP site at Enron, because they can manage the process on a daily basis.  We can sweep the FTP site daily and have it automatically imported into our databases.\nIf we are in agreement with this solution, I  will create an emergency work request with CSC to begin working on this immediately.\nMaurice"}

I only see the ones that our members install and the ones that\nour signatory contractors bid.  I don't see all the Request for Proposals.\nEach union has a jurisdiction that is unique to their craft.  The unions \nare\nthe Operating Engineers, Insulators, Sheet Metal Workers, Laborers,\nBoilermakers, Iron Workers, Electrical Workers, Teamsters, Painters,\nPipefitters and the Carpenters.\nThe prime contractor or subcontractors would use a mix of each unions\nskills.  Pre-job conferences with the contractors allow the unions to know\nwhat skills are needed and when.  Once the construction schedule is set \nthen\nthe skilled manpower arrive to the job as scheduled.  The skill levels are\nnormally predetermined by the union based on records in the files and by \nthe\ntest documentation.  Boilermakers are pre-tested for drugs and weld tested\nprior to getting to the job site.  Each craft will typically have a ratio \nof\napprentices mixed with skilled workers.\nSince all the unions share the work they all become very proficient in \ntheir\nduties.\nI hope this is helpful.\nAnde Abbott\n\nDate: Thu, 02 Aug 2001 21:52:07 +0000\n\nAnde,\nThank you very much for the information.  I was figuring that many\nconstraints was going to be the answer.\nI am curious.  The labors who install the SCRs are they in unions?  How \nmany\nunions have the labors capable of installing the SCRs?  Is it one or two \nor\nis 30 union?  Are there any people outside a union that installs SCRs?\nThanks for the info,\nMichael\n\nDate: Mon, 30 Jul 2001 19:41:46 -0400\nMichael - First I don't seeLabor as being the \"main restraint.\"  Some \nplant\nowners\nare very reluctant to get started on projects because of the New Source\nReview\nrequirements of EPA.  The cost of permitting and dealing with EPA keep\nsome\nplant owners from moving too quickly.\nIt is impossible to predict the number of SCR's that could be installed\nbecause there are too many factors that must be taken into\nconsideration.\nThings like weather, permits, size of the job, prime contractor bidding\nprocess, parts availability, manpower, scheduling the installation to\nmatch\nthe normal outage, financing and etc.  As long as the construction\nschedules come at a reasonable pace there should not be any problems of\nmanpower. Everything else is so hard to calculate.  The engineering is\nusually\npretty\ngood - but several units gave our guys fits to construct.  We pride\nourselves on delivering a job on time and at or below cost.  However we\ncan\nonly deal with those issues that are within our ability to control.\nI'm sorry I can't be more specific but it isn't like piano tuning where\nall\nfacts are known and every job nearly the same.\nAnde Abbott\n\n16:04:42 +0000 > To: andea@erols.com > Subject: SCR installations > > \nDear\nAnde Abbott, > > I am a college student following the NOx emmissions\nregulations.

The decision for the \nportal \"look and feel\" and the portal name will be made next week.  A \n\"progress before perfection\" approach is planned for releasing the portal.\n\"Killer\" or \"sticky\" applications for the new portal are being identified and \nprioritized.  All task force members are required to identify five \"killer\" \nor \"sticky\" applications by next week's IM Task Force meeting.\nSome features of Hewlitt Packard's benchmark portal are being discussed and \ntargeted for development.  \nTibco 2.0 version targeted as a requirement to provide personalized color \ntreatments for portal.

My intention was to respond to the assertion\nby Sheffrin that large nmbers of bids near the MCP  was indicative of market\npower, combined with large number of bids at much higher prices at higher MW\nlevels (e.g. bid $150/MWh at 200 MW but $300/MWh at 250 MW). The first point\nI could easily summarize more succintly, the second I think takes more\neffort.\nOf course, the fact that large numbers of bids around the MCP were submitted\nby importers merely suggests in reality that people are pretty smart, and\nnew that prices in neighboring markets (e.g. in the NW) would settle at\nsimilar levels. For those of you with an legal anti-trust background, it\nmerely confirms why the entire analysis is shaky - the fundamental market\ndefinition is wrong (market definition being one of the key elements of\nanti-trust economics and law). As even the MSC has agreed, the California\nmarket is not a market on its own, but instead is well-integrated with the\nrest of the West. So it is very difficult to look at half a market and come\nup with sensible conclusions...\nI can try to cut this down, or we can eliminate it altogether.

In all, we are lowering ratings on seven\ncompanies, price targets on thirteen, and earnings\nestimates on sixteen.\n* This follows our call (Power Curve 4, published\nMay 2) where we established a more cautious outlook\nfor Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.\n* Since our last Power Curve analysis on May 31, we\nhave seen the continued deterioration of both\nforward power prices and spark spreads.\n* June was the first period in which we have seen\nyear/year declines in power prices and spark\nspreads.  We had expected to see these signs first\nin 1Q:02.\n* We maintain a bullish outlook on those companies\nthat are not leveraged to power prices, whether\nthrough strong risk management skills or through a\nlack of generation.

Based on work in our last Power\nCurve report (Power Curve 5, 5/31/01), we had not expected the commodity\ndrivers of earnings to turn negative until 1Q:02.  Instead, we see commodity\ncomparisons turning negative in June, and on a full quarterly basis, 3Q:01.\nJune 2001  June 2000     % Change\nPower Prices ($/MWh)                     $50.21      $83.25       (40%)\nSpark Spread ($/MWh)                     $23.77      $56.93       (58%)\nIn our view, the most important measure for earnings, particularly for Power\nProducers, is the Spark Spread, which shows the gross margin potential for\npower generation in the spot market.  Hedging, trading, and the sale of other\nservices such as capacity availability and spinning reserves offsets the impact\nof a decline in this number.  Most companies with generating capacity are at\nleast 85% hedged for 2001, 60% hedged for 2002, and 40% hedged for 2003.\nNEGATIVE QUARTERLY COMMODITY DRIVERS BEGINNING 3Q:01, TWO QUARTERS AHEAD OF\nEARLIER EXPECTATIONS\nForward power and gas markets suggest that 3Q:01 will be the first full quarter\nof negative commodity comparisons.  Earlier, in PC5, we had expected this would\nnot occur until 1Q:02.  What has surprised us is the swiftness and breadth of\nthe decline in the power pricing environment.  Unlike 2Q:01, which had two good\nmonths -- April and May -- to buoy earnings, forward markets suggest year/year\ndeclines in power prices and the spark spread for all of 3Q:01 and continuing\ninto 4Q:01.  June is an important \"swing\" month in what is normally a\nrelatively volatile earnings quarter.  So far, because of lower realized prices\nand a declining power price outlook, a number of companies have either pre-\nannounced or guided to reduced earnings expectations, including:  PPL, PNW,\nPNM, NRG, KSE and CEG.\nQuarterly Comparisons, Power Prices and Spark Spreads\nDOWNGRADING STOCKS; DECLINING POWER PRICES ARE NOT GOOD FOR EARNINGS\nIn a declining power pricing environment, investors should take a more cautious\nstance on companies who are \"long\" the commodity -- i.e., companies who,\nbecause of their business model, are making a long bet on commodity prices.\nWithin this constraint, we look for signs that mitigate this exposure.\nFurthermore, we are positive on the long-run case for aggressive companies who\nare building newer, more efficient power plants and replacing the aging plant\nthat has built up under 70 years of regulation.  As long-run bets, companies\nsuch as Calpine (CPN, downgraded to 2H from 1H) offer an excellent play on\nderegulation, although we temper our outlook due to declining power prices.\nCertain other Power Producers are better positioned than others, and when we\nadd the valuation component to this discussion (the stock prices of many\nProducers peaked in late April/early May), we think a number still offer\nattractive value.\nHowever, our broad thrust is to recommend companies who are not long power (or\nhave small exposure), whether because of strong trading and risk management\nskills or a lack of generating capacity.  In Power Curve 4 (5/1/01), when we\nfirst wrote about the declining price curve, we suggested a more cautious\nstance towards Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.  We stand by that\nadvice.  We are downgrading the rating on only 1 Merchant vs. 4 Producers and\nIntegrated Utilities who are exposed to power prices.  In terms of estimates,\nonly 2 Merchants are being reduced, while we are reducing 14 Power Producers\nand Integrated Utilities.  Our top 3 growth-oriented picks for investors who\nwant to avoid the impact of declining power prices are Energy Merchants ENE,\nDYN and ILA.  For dividend or total-return investors, we recommend Integrated\nUtilities EXC, ETR, and AEP.\nMACRO VIEW:  WHY ARE POWER PRICES DECLINING?\nFigure 1.  The Forward Power Curve ($/MWh) --U.S.\n1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F\n$/MWh    $36.22    $40.53    $67.61    $73.44    $41.72    $36.81\nThe forward curve for power shows a rapid decline from peak levels achieved in\n2000 and 2001E.  Rapid growth in construction of new generating capacity is the\nprimary cause of the decline in forward price expectations (with the slowing\neconomy an additional factor in the near-term).  See Figure 2.  Additionally,\nwe cite two reasons why plant builds tend to over-shoot (either on the upside\nor the downside) changes in the demand for power.  These are because\nelectricity is capital intensive and a commodity, each of which creates cycles\nof over- and under-development.\n(1) Incremental Capacity Exceeds Incremental Demand.  The cause of\nthe current decline in prices is the rapid addition of new generating capacity,\nin all regions of the country.  Additions to capacity are exceeding increases\nin demand for power, by a wide margin, in most regions.  This has caused the\nsupply and demand balance to shift from a shortage to a growing surplus.\nAdditional factors have hastened the decline in prices.  A slowing economy has\nreduced demand, as has the absence of last year's hotter-than-normal weather.\nSo far this summer, weather has been approximately normal.\n(2) Capacity additions exceeded incremental demand in 2000.  We\nthink 2000 was the first year when incremental capacity exceeded incremental\ndemand.  We still have an underlying power shortage, which has lasted well into\n2001.  However, the market is adding capacity in a manner which should\nrelentlessly lessen its severity and even potentially create over-capacity\nwithin the next several years. In 2000, 27,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity was\nadded, up from 11,000 in 1999, and less than 10,000 MW during most of the\n1990's.  We expect approximately 45,000 MW of capacity will be added in 2001,\nand a similar number in 2002.  Since this amount exceeds the amount required to\nmeet growth in demand, we project a rising \"reserve margin.\"  The reserve\nmargin is the best fundamental indicator of the balance between supply and\ndemand, with a high reserve margin indicating over-capacity (falling power\nprices), and a low reserve margin indicating under-capacity (rising power\nprices).  We tentatively project a bottoming of the electricity commodity price\ncycle in 2003, if enough developers scale back their plans to build new plants.\nFigure 2. U.S. Capacity Additions and Reserve Margin\n1996  1997  1998   1999  2000P  2001E  2002E  2003E\nMW Additions   8,900 4,400 1,000 11,000 27,000 47,000 43,000 35,000\nReserve Margin  15%   13%   12%    10%    13%    16%    18%    18%\nTWO REASONS FOR BOOM AND BUST CYCLES IN POWER\n(1) Electricity is a cyclical commodity industry.  We have reached the peak\nof the \"first-ever\" cycle in the history of the industry.  We put \"first\" in\nquotes because we think the cycles were always there, except they were hidden\nby regulation.  With deregulation of the wholesale power market in 1996,\nmarket-clearing prices reveal the balance between supply and demand.  From 1996\nuntil mid 2001, we were climbing the mountaintop of the electricity cycle.  Now\nwe are on the downside.\n(2) Electricity production is capital-intensive.  We think the cycles will last\na number of years, 4-6 years in the current cycle (we put the first year as\n1998, when enough liquidity existed in the newly deregulated market; we see the\nbottom as 2003), driven by the capital-intensive nature of the industry.  Power\nplants take a long time to build.  Planning decisions must be made between 1\nand 5 years in advance of the actual day when power will be produced.  This is\na much slower process than the market, and pricing expectations at the time of\nplanning will have no doubt changed by the time plants are up-and-running.  We\nthink it is difficult for individual company executives to fully anticipate the\ndevelopment plans of their competitors and, in the quest for market share, the\ntendency is to build in a manner which is often too aggressive when viewed on\nan industry-wide basis years later.\nGUIDE TO INVESTORS:  INDUSTRY-LEVEL\nTRACK THE SPARK SPREAD.   A primary metric for investors to track is the\n\"spark spread\".  The spark spread measures the difference between power prices\n(revenues) and natural gas prices (cost).  This is the critical metric for\ntracking earnings power of generating companies.  The gross margin of Power\nProducers in the spot market will be determined by the spark spread, and when\nthese companies hedge, they will have to hedge using the forward spark spread\navailable at that time.  Thus, a declining spark spread affects the earnings\npower of all companies, even those who are well hedged.  Only if they could\nhedge 100% would their earnings be unaffected by declining prices.  No company\nwe are aware of has been able to hedge 100% of their output.\nThe forward spark spread actually suggests a worse commodity price environment\nin the 2002/3 period than existed in 1998/9, prior to the run-up in prices in\n2000/1.\nFigure 3. The Forward Spark Spread -- U.S.\n1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F\n$/MWh    $21.36    $23.04    $41.28    $40.65    $14.15     $9.28\nGUIDE TO INVESTORS:  COMPANY-LEVEL\nSTOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM\nThe following factors will help companies weather the storm, from most to least\nimportance:\nTrading and risk management skills.  A strong trading desk acts as the \"eyes\nand ears\" to the market, often providing advance warning of changes in the\ncommodity price outlook.  Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a\nstrong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their\ncompetitors.  The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits\nfrom trading and risk management activities, own little if any generating\ncapacity, and are characterized by a commodity price-neutral earnings model.\nAll of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help\ntheir overall activity.  Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron\n(ENE-1H).  We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price\nenvironment.  Other companies with strong trading/risk management operations\ninclude Dynegy (DYN-1H) and Aquila (ILA-1H).  Duke Energy (DUK-1H) and Mirant\n(MIR-1H) also have strong operations.  In terms of vulnerability to power\nprices, we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions, owing to the lack or\nnear-lack of generating capacity owned.\nContracting/hedging activity.  The more aggressive a company's moves were to\nlock in power prices earlier this year, the better positioned they are.\nNevertheless, the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on\nearnings, particularly in the long-run.  We note that Calpine (CPN-2H), which\nwe have downgraded to 2H from 1H, has aggressively stepped up its hedging\nactivity in recent weeks, signing a 3,000 MW deal with Shell, a 1,000 MW deal\nwith Reliant Resources (RRI-NR).  This activity appears to coincide with the\nrapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months.\nOffsetting \"short\" positions.  This is a characteristic typical of electric\nutilities, who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the\nshort obligation to sell power to their customers.  Utilities that are well-\npositioned in this regard include:  EXC and AEP.  Utilities that are most\nvulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an\neffort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play\nPower Producers.  These include:  AYE, CEG, and PPL.  We are particularly\nconcerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity, or,\nseparately, relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars\nto upgrade.  These plants are often the \"marginal\" unit, providing earnings in\ntight pricing environments, but having significantly less value as prices\ndecline.\nBacklog of plant development.  We also think that companies with significant\nplant development backlogs can \"muscle\" their way through a weakened commodity\nprice environment.  In particular, we note CPN, whose plants in operation grow\nas follows:\nFigure 4. Calpine Earnings Metrics, 2000-2003E\n2000     2001     2002     2003       CAGR\nY/E MW in operation     5,883   11,705   21,266   30,463        73%\n% of portfolio hedged             85%      71%      61%\nEPS                     $1.11    $1.95    $2.30    $3.00        39%\nThey have hedged aggressively their output from their plants, so even though\nfuture plants have lower margins, overall EPS growth can still be impressive.\nNevertheless, we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN, reflecting the\nimpact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output.  Our revised\n\"Outperform\" rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth\nover the 2000-2003 period.\nSUMMARY OF RATINGS/ESTIMATES/PRICE TARGET CHANGES\nREVISED VALUATION TABLE\nRISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE\nWe see four principal risks to our more cautious stance.\nSome horses are already out of the barn.  Power Producers and selected\nEnergy Merchants (those with exposure to power prices) are down 26% since\npeaking on May 1.  Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now\nreflected in the stocks.  However, we do not think all of the horses are out of\nthe barn, and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at\nthis time.  The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS\nestimates.  We think this is likely, particularly for 2002 and 2003, if power\nprices continue their decline.  We think when this happens, stocks are likely\nto go down further.\nHotter Weather.  So far in 2001, weather across the country has been near-\nnormal vs. hotter-than-normal weather last year.  The year-on-year moderation\nhas affected the forward curve.  Should August become hotter relative to last\nyear, the forward curve could temporarily strengthen, boosting power price and\nearnings expectations near-term.  Ultimately, we think the principal cause of\nthe decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants.  Even if the\ncurve temporarily strengthens due to weather, we still expect it will be\ndownward sloping for the next several years.\nA Rebound in the Economy.  A weak economy has certainly affected power\ndemand, which, in turn, has affected the forward curve.  When the economy\neventually rebounds, which some are predicting by 4Q:01 or early 2002, the\nforward curve should strengthen.  We will watch for these signs and adjust our\noutlook accordingly.\nCancellations of plant development plans.  This factor is a wildcard for the\ngroup in our opinion.  We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to\ncancel plant development plans.  So far, sources such as turbine manufacturer\nGE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled.  If/when\nthey occur, the cancellation of development plans will have two effects.\nFirst, it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment, and\nwould likely be perceived as negative.  Then, following the cancellation of\nenough development plans, it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power\nprices in the future.  This is why we think power prices will bottom in 2003.\nThe mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will, in part, be driven by\ncancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter\nsupply-demand balance.\nSUMMARY:  BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP.\nWe are lowering ratings, price targets and/or estimates on 11 companies with\nexposure to the declining trend in power prices.  We advise investors to be\nmore cautious on the group.  However, we continue to advise a shift toward\nEnergy Merchants, who have little or no commodity price exposure, and away from\nPower Producers, who are long power, as well as those Integrated Utilities who\nare long power.  Additionally, we see several factors that also merit a\ncautious outlook, apart from the declining trend in power prices and its\nadverse effect on earnings:\n(1) Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market\nbegins to recover and/or tech stocks begin to outperform.\n(2) Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a\ntime when many other S&P 500 sectors have \"rolled over.\"  The resumption of\nearnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away\nfrom our Growth Energy names, particularly if their earnings is now under\nchallenge.\nQUARTERLY ESTIMATES PER SHARE DATA\nCurrent Year*          Next Year        Next Year + 1\nTicker      Period  Current   Previous  Current   Previous  Current   Previous\nAES#

A similar Assembly panel\nhas been formed to look into natural gas prices. Both expect to begin hearings\nnext month.\nThe state has been struggling with a tight electricity supply since summer\ndue in part to high natural gas prices and power plant outages for scheduled \nand\nunplanned maintenance.\nBurton said he suspected electricity wholesalers shut down plants to create\nan artificial shortage and boost prices. If lawmakers find evidence of that,\nthey will turn it over to the state attorney general for action, which could\ninclude prosecution and court action to seek refunds.\n\"Clearly, early evidence suggests that there has been market manipulation by\nthe power generators which led to rolling blackouts and then higher \nelectricity\nprices,\" said Burton, D-San Francisco, referring to outages that hit Northern\nCalifornians twice in January.\nCalifornia saw a modest 4 percent increase in demand in one year, while\nwholesale power prices in that time rose 328 percent, he said.\nCommittee Chairman Joe Dunn said the panel will ask energy wholesale\nexecutives to testify, and issuing subpoenaes if necessary. Duke, Dynegy, \nMirant\nand Reliant will be among major providers included, he said.\nJan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers \nindustry group, said wholesalers will cooperate, but warned that if it \nbecomes a\n\"witch hunt\" it could discourage them from building plants in California.\n\"We believe this investigation will find nothing except that power producers\nhave been working around the clock to keep the lights on in California,\" he \nsaid\nin a written statement.\nBurton said the investigation could affect any rescue deal Gov. Gray Davis \ncrafts with the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and\nSouthern California Edison.\nDavis is negotiating the state purchase of transmission lines owned by\nEdison, PG&E and a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, to\nhelp Edison and PG&E pay their wholesale power bills.\nLawmakers need to know how much of the money owed to the wholesalers \"is\nreasonable and how much of it was basically gaming the system,\" Burton said.\nThe power generators blame the high prices on poor planning by California \nlawmakers who voted to deregulate the state's electricity market in 1996.\nThat law prevents PG&E and Edison from passing on high wholesale prices to\ntheir customers. The utilities say they are nearly $14 billion in debt and on\nthe brink of bankruptcy due to wholesale power prices that have soared since\nJune, in part because of rising natural gas prices.\nWholesalers have cut off their credit, leading the state to buy power for\nthem. California has committed $3.7 billion in tax money to such purchases \nsince\nearly January and plans to recoup it from utility customers over several \nyears.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power\ngrid, says generators imposed \"unjust and unreasonable\" charges totaling $555\nmillion during December and January.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a strong supporter of \nderegulation,\nlast week found that wholesalers have been overcharging for California \nelectricity, ordering 13 companies to refund $69 million. It gave the \ncompanies\nuntil March 23 to appeal.\nAttorneys general in California, Washington and Oregon are pursuing similar\ninvestigations. U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., has asked the Justice \nDepartment\nand Federal Trade Commission to launch inquiries.\nSen. Bill Morrow, R-Oceanside, said he wasn't \"overly impressed with\ninvestigative efforts so far on the federal level with FERC and others in \ntheir\nwillingness to actually turn over the stones.\"\nTom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy, expressed\nannoyance at the news of a Senate probe.\n\"It is wearing thin,\" said Williams, noting that Duke already has been\nsubjected to federal investigations and has testified twice before the state's\nlegislative energy committee, with no findings of wrongdoing.\nThe Assembly committee is investigating natural gas pipeline capacity and\nreserves. That committee plans to call gas company executives and FERC\nrepresentatives to testify.\nBecause natural gas is largely regulated by the federal government, \nlawmakers\nare trying to determine whether they have authority to investigate market\nmanipulation, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek.\nIn Washington, FERC said it would overhaul its regulation of the Western\nenergy market to increase supply. Changes include:\n- Letting large commercial power users sell power they save at a wholesale\nrate to be set by the commission.\n- Reallocating FERC staff to work on applications for natural gas pipeline\nand hydroelectric projects.\n- Urging hydroelectric plant operators to examine how they can more fully \nuse\ntheir available water resources by adding or upgrading turbines or making \nother\nimprovements.\nOn the Net:\nCalifornia ISO: www.caiso.com\nFERC: www.ferc.fed.us\nGRAPHIC: AP Photos SC101-102\nLOAD-DATE: March 14, 2001\n10 of 28 DOCUMENTS\nThe Associated Press State & Local Wire\nThe materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., \nwho\nsaid it would put the Senate in the inappropriate position of deciding the\n\"pecking order\" of creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.\nCalifornia's two biggest utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific\nGas and Electric, say they've been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by more\nthan $13 billion in high wholesale power costs that state law has barred them\nfrom recouping from consumers.\nBoth were denied credit by electricity wholesalers earlier this year. To \nkeep\nthe lights on for their customers, the state in early January began spending\nbillions to buy power on their behalf.\nMeanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis is negotiating with Edison, PG&E and the state's\nthird investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., to purchase their\ntransmission lines.\nThe governor says the state acquisition would give the utilities a\nmuch-needed influx of cash and help them pay their debts.\nLOAD-DATE: March 14, 2001\n12 of 28 DOCUMENTS\nThe Associated Press State & Local Wire\nThe materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press.

John Burton and Joe Dunn announce a Senate committee will \ninvestigate\nwhether power generators illegally manipulated California's electricity market\nto drive up prices over the past year. If the panel finds wrongdoing, the \nstate\nattorney general should sue for refunds, Burton said.\nThe committee will ask wholesalers' executives to testify, and subpoena them\nif they refuse, said Burton, D-San Francisco, the Senate leader.\n- A legislative aide says the Senate panel is considering issuing subpoenaes\nfor wholesaler documents on the California market and asking the companies'\nexecutives to testify.\n- Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams expresses annoyance at the news of a\nSenate probe, saying there have already been several investigations and no\nfinding of wrongdoing.\n- Assemblyman Fred Keeley says the Assembly has formed a committee to look\ninto natural gas issues. Because natural gas is largely regulated by the \nfederal\ngovernment, lawmakers are trying to figure out whether they have the authority\nto investigate whether supply and prices were manipulated.\n- Gov. Gray Davis' administration continues negotiations with Edison, PG&E\nand San Diego Gas & Electric over the governor's plan to buy their \ntransmission\nlines to help Edison and PG&E pay their debts.\n- The state remained free of power alerts as power reserves stayed at \nhealthy\nlevels.\n- Assembly members Fred Keeley and Hannah-Beth Jackson and environmental\ngroups plan a news conference to urge approval of energy conservation and\nrenewable energy proposals.\nTUESDAY:\n- Davis issues an executive order promising 20 percent rebates to Southern\nCalifornia Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and San Diego utility \ncustomers\nwho cut power use 20 percent this summer.\n- Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill's office says Davis is underestimating\nCalifornia's summer electricity shortage. The state faces a shortfall of 3,900\nto 7,100 megawatts during daily periods of peak demand, the report says. One\nmegawatt is enough for about 1,000 homes.\nUsing flawed state Energy Commission numbers, the governor is overestimating\nhow much new electricity generation will be online this summer, especially \nearly\nin the season, and overestimates savings from conservation, the report says.\n- The state Senate plans to form a special committee to investigate whether\npower generators illegally manipulated California's electricity market to \ndrive\nup prices. The suppliers vehemently deny such allegations.\n- Citing skyrocketing energy costs, particularly in the West, President Bush\nbacks off a campaign pledge and tells Congress he will not regulate carbon\ndioxide emissions from power plants. The decision comes after heavy lobbying\nfrom the coal industry and is a blow to conservationists who see curbing\nemissions of such \"greenhouse gases\" as key to reducing global warming.\n- State Controller Kathleen Connell says legal issues prevent her from\nreleasing records on state power purchases sought under the state open records\nlaw by The Associated Press and several other news organizations. Connell says\nshe is awaiting an opinion by Attorney General Bill Lockyer on whether she can\nrelease the information. Davis opposes releasing it.\n- Secretary of State Bill Jones calls for an audit of the state's energy\nspending, saying the secrecy around the contracts for power purchases has led \nto\na lack of oversight and accountability.\n- Proposals for two new power plants that could be running by summer have\nbeen received by the California Energy Commission. The plants, which together\nwill produce 225 megawatts, will be fast-tracked through the application \nprocess\nto help meet higher electricity demands this summer. That's roughly enough \npower\nfor 225,000 homes.\n- Officials say guidelines expected Wednesday on whether Edison, PG&E or\ntheir customers will begin paying off the $3.7 billion in taxpayer money\ncommitted to buying power on their behalf will likely be delayed.\n- No power alerts are declared, as operators of the state grid continue to\nfind enough electricity to meet demand.\n- Eight California counties expect to lose $11.1 million in property taxes \nin\nthe next five months because the five energy producers who owe the money say\nthey are due even more from Southern California Edison. Some school districts \nin\nthose counties - Imperial, San Joaquin, Riverside, Alameda, Contra Costa, \nInyo,\nKern and San Bernardino - say the defaults could hurt their ability to finance\nexpansions or repairs.\n- Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt meets with Los Angeles city officials to discuss\nexpanding a coal-fired power station in Utah to send electricity to Southern\nCalifornia. \n- The United Farmworkers Union holds a protest in Blythe, a desert community\nnear the Arizona border, to protest a proposed power plant opponents contend\nwould pollute the air farmworkers breathe.\n- U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Palo Alto Democrat, asks U.S. Attorney General \nJohn\nAshcroft to investigate whether electricity wholesalers engaged in unlawful\ntrade practices to drive prices higher.\n- A 510-megawatt power plant in western San Diego County moved a step closer\nto final approval. The Otay Mesa generating project won approval from the\nCalifornia Energy Commission's siting committee. The public 30 days to comment\non the plan.\n- Edison International stock falls 47 cents a share to close at $14.88;\nPacific Gas and Electric Corp. stock closes at $14.24, dropping 28 cents a\nshare.\nWHAT'S NEXT:\n- The Legislature considers dozens of bills to encourage energy \nconservation,\nincrease alternative power and streamline power plant siting.\n- The California Public Utility Commission meets Thursday to consider \nwhether\nto bar PG&E and Edison from laying off about 3,000 workers. The utilities say \nit\ncould help them cut costs and ease their $14 billion debt. A PUC \nadministrative\nlaw judge says the layoffs could cause response times to customer outages to\nsuffer.\nThe PUC will also discuss restructuring the interruptible customer program.\nThe program gives big electricity users a discounted rate in return for \nshutting\ndown their power when the state is short of electricity. After January's \nrolling\nblackouts, the PUC froze the program and said PG&E and Edison could no longer\nfine interruptible customers for not complying.\n- An order from Davis requiring businesses to substantially reduce outdoor\nlighting after business hours takes effect Thursday. Businesses that fail to\ncomply face a potential fine of $1,000 a day.\n- Attorneys for three generators and the ISO return to federal court March\n19, when a judge is expected to decide whether power suppliers can be forced \nto\nsell to the grid.\n- Generators have until March 23 to appeal an order by federal regulators to\nrefund $69 million in January power charges. The Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission required suppliers to justify prices exceeding $150 per megawatt\nhour. It determined last week that some sales were priced too high, even \ntaking\ninto account high natural gas prices, air quality control costs and plant\nmaintenance.\nTHE PROBLEM:\n- High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission bottlenecks and a\ntight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and\nmaintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's \nelectricity crisis.\nEdison and PG&E say they've lost $13.7 billion since June to high wholesale\nprices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing \nonto\nratepayers, and are close to bankruptcy.\nElectricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor\ncredit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state to start \nbuying\npower for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers.\nLOAD-DATE: March 14, 2001"}

{"id": "637", "contents": "Summary of RTO Week Day 2 -- Congestion Management\nRTO Week\nDay 2 -- October 16, 2001\nCongestion Management and Transmission Rights\nThe morning panel discussed congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.\nGeneral Observations\nThe Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system is not going to change in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.    \nOpening Statements\nNancy Brockway:  focus on two topics:  1) flowgate vs. LMP; and 2) relationship between congestion management (CM) and resource planning.  She supports LMP and standard market design in New England.  Flowgate rights are cumbersome, create unnecessary uplift costs - freezing power distribution factors is bad and could result in some free rides.  She is a Hogan follower, and Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult.  With regard to the relationship between CM and resource planning, transmission is a monopoly, and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision - decide where to site generation or transmission and take a risk.  FERC should not override that principle.  Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut congestion management.\nReem Fahey:  RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator.  Cannot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion.  CM should have a bid-based structure with LMP.  Design of CM should allow flexibility for market participants to be in the spot and forward markets.  Transmission rights - must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hedging in real time.  FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs and market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load.  These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system.\nCarol Guthrie:  Her company has diverse interests in electricity market - over 4,000 service locations, over 150 suppliers, more than 15 sites where they have industrial generation serving own load (500 MW).  \nShmuel Oren:  Advocates minimal ISOs, direct assignment of congestion costs in real time, flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralized coordination and supports forward rights.  Does not support \"one size fits all.\"  Need to understand gaming, modes of market failure.  Problems in Texas - people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve the congestion.  Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable.\nAndy Ott:  There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works.  It's an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during constraints.  PJM has been using nodal pricing since 1998.  Utilities have run their system on this approach for years - economic dispatch to meet demand.  Cannot do balancing and CM separately -- does not work.  Transmission rights must be financial.  Spot market is physical.  Financial model is the hedging.  You need this separation because it allows players to do bilaterals or buy or sell from the spot market.  Also allows FTRs to be traded and used to protect from congestion.  \nMichael Schnitzer:  There is a preferred method of CM - the LMP based CM system with financial rights.  DAM and RT bid-based security constrained locational pricing markets.  Bilateral transactions are allowed.  Transmission rights must be financial, not physical.  Allows transmission users to hedge congestion costs.  Why is CM so important?  Need to get the prices right to give the right signals to the market.  Three goals:  1) get dispatch right - show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can respond accordingly; 2) price signals to generation for location purposes - clarifies responsibility and risk allocations; 3) market signals for when to expand the grid - LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FTRs.\nLocational Marginal Pricing\nThe panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.  \nFTRs versus Flowgates\nThe panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.\nThe panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.\nFERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or flowgates are actually more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.\nOptions versus Obligations\nThe panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.  \nThe afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.  \nLet me know if you have any questions.\nSarah"}

The merger, announced this month, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002.\nS&P, which said it may cut Houston-based Enron's \"BBB-minus\" and \"A-3\" long-and short-term unsecured debt ratings, each one notch above junk, said the chance Enron will have to pay off the note raises \"liquidity issues,\" but that \"given the alignment of interests between Enron and the banks,\" Enron's ability to renegotiate the note \"will be successful.\" \nEnron said in its quarterly report, filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that it has less than $2 billion of available cash and credit lines. It said in the filing the recent S&P downgrade to \"BBB-minus\" may force it to pay off the $690 million note by Tuesday if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt of an affiliated partnership. \nEnron shares traded Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange at $6.99, down $2.07, or 22.9 percent, on volume topping 53 million shares. They have fallen more than 91 percent in 2001 amid accounting problems, earnings restatements, a federal investigation and management changes.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Remond\n11/20/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nA Dow Jones Newswires Column \nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Investors are running for the exits as doubts about Enron Corp.'s (ENE) planned merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN) mount.\nDebt and equity markets are taking news of Enron's never ending credit woes with renewed pessimism Tuesday, sending the company's stock down almost 24% and its bonds sharply lower. \nAnd with so much riding on Dynegy's financial support, risk arbitrageurs, those investors who bet on the stock price of companies involved in merger, aren't willing to play. \"There is just too much risk,\" said a trader at a New York risk arbitrage firm. \"Nobody wants to even get close to the deal.\" \nPerhaps most telling about the uncertainty surrounding Enron and the merger with Dynegy is the fact that even a 68% risk premium over the value of the Dynegy deal has so far failed to attract investors. \"The deal appears in real jeopardy here,\" a bond trader said. \nUnder the merger plan, Enron holders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share. At Dynegy's current share price of $41.77, that means the value of the deal is about $11.20 a share for Enron holders. But Enron stock recently traded as low as $6.68 a share, almost 68% below the value of the merger. \nAdding to doubts about Enron's long-term viability, the company said in a delayed quarterly filing late Monday that its ability to continue as a going concern depends on a number of factors, including being able to retain an investment grade credit rating. \nDynegy declined to comment on whether its decision to merge with Enron would be affected by the company's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filing, including the disclosure that Enron will have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it doesn't come up with collateral for a loan. \nAn Enron spokeswoman wasn't available to comment on the merger plan. \nAmong other bad news, Enron's latest report warned investors that the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debt if its credit rating is downgraded any further. \nEarlier this month, Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service cut Enron's credit ratings to \"BBB-\" and \"Baa3\", just one notch higher than below-investment grade, or \"junk\" status. The rating agencies warned that they may cut their respective ratings again. Neither S&P nor Moody's were available for comment Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, as investors look at the Dynegy deal as Enron's one and only hope to avoid bankruptcy, bondholders are also showing renewed worries. \nEnron's 7 7/8% bonds due in 2003 are down about 10 cents on the day, now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar. Subordinated bonds due in 2005 are also sharply lower, changing hands at about 62 cents on the dollar. \nEnron has set a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks, and in some cases keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a SEC probe into its accounting and disclosure practice, the company recently restated its earnings, reducing profits taken over previous years by more than $500 million. Enron also took steps to consolidate some debt back on its books. \nCarol S. Remond; 201-938-2074; Dow Jones Newswires \ncarol.remond@dowjones.com\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\nDynegy Won't Comment On Merger Partner Enron's 10-Q\nBy Christina Cheddar\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n11/20/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) declined Tuesday to comment on whether its merger with Enron Corp. (ENE) would be affected by the contents of Enron's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Monday. \nIn the 10-Q, which was filed five days past the SEC deadline, Enron revised its third-quarter earnings downward by 3 cents a share, and disclosed it may have to pay off a $690 million note owed to an affiliated partnership because a clause in a financial agreement was triggered by the reduction in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's a week ago.\nThe amount will have to be paid by Nov. 27 if Enron doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt, the company said in the filing. Enron is working to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt, but didn't disclose who holds the note. \nEnron used partnerships in order to hedge its investment risk, and in some cases to keep the debt off its balance sheet. The practice is being investigated by the SEC and by an internal committee Enron has named. \nIn the filing, Enron also said it may have to take a $700 million pretax charge to earnings for the declining value of assets held by another partnership, Whitewing LLP. \nWhen asked if Dynegy had known about the collateral call on the debt or about the decline in Whitewing's value, a Dynegy spokeswoman declined to comment. \n\"We are referring all questions about the Enron 10-Q to Enron,\" said the spokeswoman. Representatives of Enron weren't immediately available for comment. \nDynegy agreed to buy Enron earlier this month. Earlier Tuesday, the deal was worth about $11.97 billion in stock, but Enron shares were trading at a 32.5% discount to the offer price earlier Tuesday morning, which is a sign of the uncertainty surrounding the transaction. \nEnron shares were recently trading at $7.86, down $1.20, or 13.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $43.29, down 31 cents, or 0.8%. \nA ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX) official wasn't immediately available to comment on the matter. \nChevronTexaco, San Francisco, owns 26% of Dynegy and is providing $2.5 billion in cash to Dynegy as part of the buyout. Last week, an inital payment of $1.5 billion was transferred to Dynegy and then to Enron to help meet Enron's immediate cash needs. \nDynegy's merger agreement with Enron contains several provisions beyond the standard \"material adverse change\" provision that would allow the deal to be terminated. Still, some question whether Dynegy was able to fully assess Enron's liabilities prior to striking the deal. \nInvestors have expressed frustration with Enron's lack of disclosure, and even marvelled at the fact that the 10-Q included material that could have been mentioned in previous filings or company conference calls. \n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166\nchristina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n(Corrected 1:50 PM) \nEnron Corp.

The SEC is investigating\nsome of Enron's partnerships.\nFirms that audit public companies submit to ``peer reviews''\nof their accounting practices by other accounting firms, a\npractice aimed at assuring the investing public that the firm\ncomplies with professional standards.\nU.S. Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said\nyesterday in a letter to Bowsher that none of the Big Five\naccounting firms has ever issued a negative report against another\nat the end of any peer review.\nDingell Skeptical\n``There appears to be little reason for the public to have\nfaith in Andersen or the peer review process,'' Dingell wrote.\nAndersen responded saying it had faith in the accounting\nprofession's self-regulatory process, which the POB oversees.\nA spokeswoman at Deloitte & Touche LLP, Andersen's peer-\nreviewer, didn't return a telephone call seeking comment.\nDeloitte, the third-largest reviewer, is conducting a peer review\nof Andersen now.\nBowsher, a former U.S. Comptroller General, said the POB was\nthinking of looking into peer review issues before receiving\nDingell's letter.\n``But this letter certainly focuses the issue,'' he said.\nDingell's letter said the outside counsel to a special\ncommittee of Enron's board has retained Deloitte & Touche to help\nit review the company's accounting problems.\nConflict of Interest?\n``Do DT's dual roles create a conflict of interest?''\nDingell's letter asked. ``If DT finds numerous problems on Enron,\nwill DT try to `whitewash' or reconcile them in order to be able\nto issue a clean peer review report?''\nDingell also questioned whether the money Andersen pays\nDeloitte & Touche for its current peer review will sway the\noutcome.\n``How will this influence, if at all, DT's `independent'\njudgment of Andersen's work on Enron?'' the letter said.\nBowsher responded: `There's nothing we can do to change the\nfact that Deloitte & Touche has done the previous reviews of\nAndersen. Now, the question is should they (the outside counsel)\nuse the same firm, or would it be better for them to use another\nfirm? And that's pretty much their decision.''\nBowsher said he has no knowledge of the accounting problems\nat Enron beyond what he's read in newspapers.\n``It looks pretty bad, doesn't it?,'' he said.\nExpanded Power\nDingell's request could prove a test of the POB's recently\nexpanded power and oversight. The group's charter was revised\nearlier this year to make the POB the accounting industry's\npremier watchdog group following criticisms by former SEC Chairman\nArthur Levitt and former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner. They\ncriticized the ``alphabet soup'' of accounting self-regulators and\nvoiced frustration with the industry's oversight of itself.\nThe new charter put the POB in charge of supervising the\nsetting of auditing and audit-independence standards and\nmonitoring how firms audit public companies. It also gave the\nboard, which is funded by the industry, the power to set its own\nbudget with no strings attached.\n``Now, for the first time, we will see if the POB is able to\nact in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to\nit by Congressman Dingell and by its new charter,'' Turner said.\n``They didn't have the power in the past.''\nThe POB was set up in 1977 to represent the public interest\nin overseeing the accounting industry's self-governance structure.\nBefore its charter was revised, the POB was just one facet of the\nenforcement of auditing industry standards regarding publicly\ntraded companies. Now, it oversees the activities of these other\ngroups as well.\nNewPower Plugs Cash Drain by Revamping Power Pact With Enron\n2001-11-20 11:05 (New York)\nNewPower Plugs Cash Drain by Revamping Power Pact With Enron\nWashington, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- NewPower Holdings Inc.,\none of the first companies to market power to homeowners\nnationwide, recently plugged a cash drain brought on by plunging\nenergy prices.\nThe Purchase, New York, company buys gas and electricity from\nsuppliers such as Enron Corp. and resells the energy to\nresidential and small business customers in states such as\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia and Texas. NewPower markets its\nservice as an alternative to local utilities in restructured\nretail energy markets.\nRecent declines in energy prices have required NewPower to\ndeposit $110 million in cash with Enron, its largest shareholder\nas well as a major creditor, leaving the company with about $33\nmillion. According to a regulatory filing, Enron recently agreed\nto allow NewPower to replace some of the cash collateral with\nassets such as inventory and customer IOUs.\n``We had a certain amount of cash tied up in those collateral\npositions,'' said William Jacobs, chief financial officer at\nNewPower. ``Obviously, every dollar you put up there reduces the\namount of money you can spend other places.''\nNewPower represents a new breed of energy middleman that\ncontracts to provide power to retail customers at certain prices.\nRather than owning power plants and gas pipelines, though, the\ncompany simply purchases energy -- at slightly lower prices --from\nsuppliers such as Enron.\nThe contracts with Enron require NewPower to post collateral\nwith the supplier if the market price of natural gas or\nelectricity falls below the price set in the contract. And prices\nfor natural gas, used to fuel most electricity plants, have\nplunged.\nOffsetting Contracts\nNatural gas for December delivery fell 4.6 cents to $2.740\nper million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile\nExchange. That is down from a record $10.10 per million British\nthermal units last December.\nNewPower isn't at risk of losing money because the company\nhas offsetting contracts to sell the electricity and natural gas\nat even higher prices to retail customers. It's more of a timing\nissue: the company has had to post the collateral before the sales\nunder these retail contracts take place.\nNevertheless, the need to provide collateral has weighed\nheavily on NewPower's balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents\nhave declined to $33.4 million on Sept. 30 from $179.9 million on\nDec. 31, 2000. Meanwhile, restricted cash, such as the collateral\nprovided to Enron and others, has ballooned to $180.2 million from\n$16.2 million during the same period.\nOther Transactions\nOn Oct. 18, according to a quarterly report filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, Enron agreed to permit\nNewPower to substitute inventory and customer receivables for as\nmuch as $40 million of the cash collateral. This agreement will\nexpire Jan. 4, 2002.\n``Assuming broadly stable forward energy prices,'' the filing\nsaid, NewPower ``has sufficient financial resources to conduct its\nbusiness until it secures permanent asset-backed or similar\nfinancing.''\nThe company also said in the SEC filing that it has recently\nentered into a series of transactions ``to reduce the risk of\nposting additional cash as collateral'' if energy prices fall\nfurther. These transactions, which the company says are an\nexception to its usual hedging strategy, ``increase the company's\nexposure to commodity price fluctuations.''\nJoint Venture\nNewPower was formed as a joint venture between Enron, General\nElectric Capital Corp., the California Public Employee's\nRetirement System, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, and\nthe merchant banking arm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., now\nowned by Credit Suisse Group.\nIn October 2000, the company held an initial public offering\nof 24 million common shares at $21 each. NewPower shares have\nfallen more than 83 percent so far this year and now trade at\n$1.60 each.\nEnron Falls After Company Cuts Earnings, Says $690 Mln Note Due\n2001-11-20 09:39 (New York)\nEnron Falls After Company Cuts Earnings, Says $690 Mln Note Due\nHouston, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares fell as\nmuch as 10 percent after the biggest energy trader restated third-\nquarter earnings for a second time this month and said it may have\nto make early payment of a $690 million note next week.\nShares of Enron, which agreed to a takeover by rival Dynegy\nInc. this month after a financial crisis threatened it with\nbankruptcy, fell 86 cents to $8.20. Dynegy fell $1.30 to $42.30.\nEnron reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share,\nbringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according\nto a U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission filing. On Nov. 8,\nEnron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect\nlosses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the\nbooks. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million.\nA drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by\nStandard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the\n$690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to\nguarantee the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the\ncompany said in the filing released yesterday after the U.S. stock\nmarket closed.\nWithout repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership\nthat owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the\npartnership's assets, Enron said. The company said it's working\nwith lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.\nEnron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and\ntake debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors\nquestioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide\nlosses from failed investments.\nChief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month\nthat buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost\nEnron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity.\nMaking good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated\npartnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said.\nEnron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible\npreferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to\nwrite down its assets by $700 million, the filing said.\nDynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued\nat $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. Both companies are based\nin Houston.\nChevronTexaco Corp., the second-largest U.S. oil company,\nowns 26 percent of Dynegy and is providing $2.5 billion in cash as\npart of the Enron buyout.\nShares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $1.63\nto $84.54.\nOptions Report: Traders Wary As Mkt Shows 'Lack Of Fear'\nBy Kopin Tan and Marcelo Prince\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n11/20/2001\nDow Jones Capital Markets Report\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stock market investors may give thanks for stocks' surge this fall. But in the options market, all that feel-good bullishness has only given investors pause. \nWith options sentiment indicators all showing what traders say is \"a lack of fear,\" option investors - many of them famously contrarian - are beginning to become more fearful. A number are hedging their long stock positions with options or becoming more bearish in their short-term outlooks, even with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving technically into bull-market territory this week, and the Nasdaq Composite Index up more than 37% from its late-September low.\n\"Is it possible the market could embark on a new sustained bull market? I don't think so,\" said Jay Shartsis, director of option trading at R.F. Lafferty & Co. It will take more than 18 months to work out the excesses of the last bull market, he added, arguing the fall rally has a \"limited shelf life.\" \nMeanwhile, the 20-day moving average of the ratio of puts traded to calls has continued to ease. The various volatility indexes have fallen to their lowest levels since late-August, despite the greater uncertainty facing the financial market since September. To many options market watchers, these signs of mounting investor confidence do not auger well for this bull run's longevity, since rallies often run out of steam when bullishness reaches a peak. So many investors continue taking profits or moving to lock in profits with defensive puts. \nIn the technology sector, for instance, the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq Volatility index, or QQV, continued slipping down to the low-40 mark when it fell 0.67 to 42.04. This tech-sector fear gauge has fallen 23% so far in November and is off 50.7% from its late-September peak, a decline inversely proportional to the roughly 50% gain posted by the Nasdaq 100 Tracking stock, or QQQ. \nJust how low is the current QQV level? So far this year, QQV has closed below 40 just five times, all during the traditionally slower summer months. In contrast, the QQV has closed above 50 for 132 sessions this year, and above 60 at least 52 times. With the QQV near its year low, many traders are bracing for it to rise again, and it rises when investors bid up protective put prices in the options of Nasdaq 100 Tracking Stock, or QQQ. This in turn happens when the Nasdaq 100 index tumbles. \nEnron Corp., whose stock has been extremely volatile of late, saw implied volatility of its options spike even higher after it warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in asset value could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. \nEnron stock fell $2.15 or 24% to $6.85. The implied volatility of its December 5 calls reached as high as about 158%, compared with historical level of about 94%. The volatility of its defensive puts were even higher at about 175% as investors traded those aggressively, noted Paul Foster, options strategist at Beyondthebull.com. The near-month options were trading fast and furious. \nMeanwhile, investors also found places to make bullish bets despite their cautious stance. \nConoco Inc.'s calls traded actively as its stock continued to rise amid speculation that another suitor might make a bid for the oil company. Conoco had agreed to merge with Phillips Petroleum Co. in a stock swap that offered its shareholders hardly any premium, yet its stock has risen instead of fallen, driven by rumors that a \"white knight\" bid might materialize. \nImplied volatility has been steady in Conoco's January calls, but it seems the possibility of another offer has made some investors more interested, said a trader at Botta Capital, the CBOE specialist for these options. \nConoco stock was up 98 cents or 3.8% to $26.96, following a 6.9% rise Monday. The in-the-money January 25 calls were active as \"retail\" or individual investors bought these calls, each of which allow the holder to buy 100 Conoco shares for $25 apiece. These calls rose 65 cents to $2.80 on CBOE volume of 510 contracts, compared with open interest of 2,596. \nConoco's January 27.50 calls also were active as some investors bought stock and sold these calls to offset the cost of the buying the stock. These calls rose $1.10 to $1.55 on CBOE volume of 872 contracts, while 786 contracts traded at other exchanges. Open interest was 807. \nOracle Corp.'s near-term calls also traded briskly as an institutional investor bought these. It isn't clear what prompted the call buying. The investor might be making a bullish bet on the database software maker in the final days of its fiscal second quarter. In addition, an influential analyst at Morgan Stanley also had made positive comments in a recent note. \nVolatility of Oracle's near-term options remains little changed, said a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for these options. Oracle executives had warned last week it would miss second-quarter earnings goals, but the volatility did not ease much, indicating that investors expect the stock to be volatile at least until its earnings report in December. \nOracle's December 15 calls fell 15 cents to 85 cents on CBOE volume of 12,713 contracts, compared with open interest of 62,103 contracts. Oracle shares slipped 19 cents to $14.68. \n-By Kopin Tan, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2202 \nkopin.tan@dowjones.com \n(Marcelo Prince of Dow Jones Newswires contributed to this report.)\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We don't need any more surprises,\" Malik told reporters at a press presentation of a new index devised by Houston-based Reliant to track natural gas consumption. \nReliant is a big wholesale electricity and natural gas trader and as such both a competitor and trading counterparty of Enron. \nMalik said Enron executives had not mentioned the potential payment of $690 million during a conference call with analysts on Nov. 14, two days before the credit rating downgrade that triggered it on Nov. 12. \nEnron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. for some $9 billion in stock on Nov. 9 after a collapse in investor confidence and snowballing financial problems brought Enron to the brink of collapse. \nDynegy wrote clauses into its agreement with Enron that allow it to walk away from the deal if the problems at Enron turn out to be far worse than previously disclosed, but Dynegy executives have said it is unlikely those clauses will be invoked. \nMalik said that as a trading partner in wholesale energy markets, Reliant will seek further clarification from Enron about its financial position. \n\"My guess is that they are going to have a hard time coming up with the money,\" he said. \nMalik said Enron's bids and offers in the wholesale electricity and natural gas markets had become less competitive in recent weeks and that this had allowed Reliant and other companies to capture some market share from Enron. \nReliant continued to do business with Enron, he said, but was exercising \"heightened caution\". \nMalik said Reliant had not hired any traders away from Enron recently and was currently well staffed. \"But you always look for good people, you always look for talent,\" he added.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ChevronTexaco Inc affiliate Dynegy Inc, which agreed to acquire Enron for 8.5 bln usd in cash and paper, was down 20 cents, or 0.46 pct, at 43.40. ChevronTexaco was up 3.15 usd at 86.06.\nThe DJIA was down 71.69 points at 9,904.77 and the S&P 500 was down 5.42 points at 1145.24. \nIn a 10Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said that because of a credit rating downgrade last week, it now faces a debt payment of 690 mln usd by Nov 27. \nIt also restated its third-quarter earnings, lowering them by 3 cents per share. \nWall Street analysts, however, said the announcement was not surprising following the company's recent credit downgrades and Enron's board investigation into the company's balance sheet. \nThey also said the news should not endanger Enron's purchase by ChevronTexaco affiliate Dynegy. \nCredit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer, who maintained his strong buy rating on Enron, said he expects the company's 690 mln usd obligation will be renegotiated, and \"satisfied out of (Enron's) current cash position of 1.5 bln usd or collateralized.\" \nThe analyst said he already had factored in a reduction in Enron's fourth-quarter EPS, to 40 cents from 48 previously, because of those expected issues. However, he now expects fourth-quarter EPS of 25-35 cents. \nAs for the Dynegy deal, Launer sees a 90 pct probability that it will be completed, as Dynegy \"demonstrably benefits from it and Chevron Texaco supports it.\" \nYesterday, ChevronTexaco chairman David O'Reilly reaffirmed support for the company's decision to invest 2.5 bln usd in Dynegy. \nThe Enron/Dynegy deal does contain a \"material adverse change (MAC)\" clause that could break the deal, but only if Enron liabilities exceed 2 bln usd net of insurance or reserves. \nIn its 10Q filing, Enron also detailed its plans to dispose of 8 bln usd of non-core assets, mainly international and broadband assets. \nCSFB's Launer said his strong buy rating on Enron, reflects his expectations that the deal spread, currently at about 30 pct, will narrow as progress is made toward a closing. \nCSFB disclosed that Launer's immediate family owns shares of Enron, estimated at less than 250. \nng/gc For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bowsher, a former U.S. comptroller general, asked in\nan interview. The board's examination will consider the broad\nissue of industry oversight, leaving specific review of Enron's\naudits to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said.\nHouston-based Enron, the largest energy trader, this month\nsaid it overstated earnings by $586 million over four-and-a-half\nyears, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion because of an\naccounting error, and failed to consolidate results of three\naffiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.\nThe oversight board, created to supervise the accounting\nindustry's self-governance practices, will address the issue Dec.\n4, Bowsher said.\nAndersen, the world's fifth-largest accounting firm, was\nEnron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring investors\nthat the company's financial statements conformed with generally\naccepted accounting principles. Deloitte & Touche LLP has been the\nfirm assigned to do Andersen's peer reviews.\nDingell Skeptical\nU.S. Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,\nquestioned the peer review process yesterday in a letter to\nBowsher. None of the five biggest international accounting firms\nhas ever issued a negative peer-review report against another,\nDingell said. The so-called Big Five are Andersen, Deloitte &\nTouche, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, KPMG LLP, and Ernst & Young\nLP.\n``There appears to be little reason for the public to have\nfaith in Andersen or the peer review process,'' Dingell wrote.\nAndersen responded that it has faith in the accounting\nprofession's self-regulatory process, which the POB oversees.\nA spokeswoman at Deloitte & Touche didn't return a telephone\ncall seeking comment.\nThe oversight board was thinking of looking into peer review\nissues before receiving Dingell's letter, Bowsher said. ``But this\nletter certainly focuses the issue,'' he said.\nConflict of Interest?\nDingell's letter said the outside counsel to a special\ncommittee of Enron's board has retained Deloitte & Touche --\nAndersen's peer reviewer -- to help it examine the company's\naccounting problems.\n``Do (Deloitte & Touche's) dual roles create a conflict of\ninterest?'' Dingell's letter asked. ``If (Deloitte & Touche) finds\nnumerous problems on Enron, will (Deloitte & Touche) try to\n`whitewash' or reconcile them in order to be able to issue a clean\npeer review report?''\nDingell also questioned whether the money Andersen pays\nDeloitte & Touche for its peer review will sway the outcome.\n``How will this influence, if at all, (Deloitte & Touche's)\n`independent' judgment of Andersen's work on Enron?'' Dingell\nasked.\nBowsher there is ``nothing we can do to change the fact that\nDeloitte & Touche has done the previous reviews of Andersen. Now,\nthe question is should they (the outside counsel) use the same\nfirm, or would it be better for them to use another firm? And\nthat's pretty much their decision.''\nExpanded Power\nDingell's request could prove a test of the oversight board's\nexpanded power and oversight. The group's charter was revised\nearlier this year to make the board the accounting industry's\npremier watchdog group, following criticisms by former SEC\nChairman Arthur Levitt and former SEC chief accountant Lynn\nTurner. They criticized an ``alphabet soup'' of accounting self-\nregulators and voiced frustration with the industry's oversight of\nitself.\nThe new charter put the oversight board in charge of\nsupervising the setting of auditing and audit-independence\nstandards and monitoring how firms audit public companies. It also\ngave the board, which is funded by the industry, the power to set\nits own budget with no strings attached.\n``Now, for the first time, we will see if the POB is able to\nact in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to\nit by Congressman Dingell and by its new charter,'' Turner said.\n``They didn't have the power in the past.''\nThe Public Oversight Board was set up in 1977 to represent\nthe public interest in overseeing the accounting industry's self-\ngovernance structure. Before its charter was revised, the board\nwas just one facet of the enforcement of auditing industry\nstandards regarding publicly traded companies. Now, it oversees\nthe activities of these other groups as well.\nEnergy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders\nBy Mark Golden\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n11/20/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said. \nFor weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month.\n\"It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now,\" said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in Houston. \nTraders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation, but declined to say so on the record. \n\"Nobody will take Enron,\" one western electricity broker said. After struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to Enron Tuesday morning. \nCalpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was willing to sell power to Enron. \n\"We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation closely,\" spokeswoman Catherine Potter said. \nThe situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell to Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at the company said. That company's trading, however, was still limited to the spot markets. \nCredit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company were heightened with Enron's filing of its third quarter annual report Monday evening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. \nEnron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligation with the company's most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday's filing. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity. \n\"The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns,\" Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said. \"We have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they are going to manage the situation.\" \nCompanies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer \nAn Enron spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. \nReliant Resources (RRI) and the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal government's western power marketer, both said their organizations are continuing to \"do business\" with Enron. But when asked specifically if they were selling spot power or gas to Enron, spokesmen for both declined to comment. \n\"We're watching the situation very carefully,\" said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. \"There is a lot of speculation because of the filing yesterday.\" \nEnergy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. \nTraders and their companies have said consistently that until Enron's credit ratings improve, they will continue to watch their exposure to Enron carefully, with trades limited to short-term deals. \nMoody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating \"evolving.\" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings. \nThe manager of one hedge fund that follows Enron closely said Tuesday that several trading companies expressed strong concerns about Enron's financial viability. But the manager thought those concerns weren't proportionate to Enron's position. \n\"They have nine days to work out the $690 million debt payment, and if they can't work it out, they have the cash to make the payment,\" the manager said. \nDynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron in a stock-swap currently worth about $10 billion, injected $1.5 billion into Enron last week. Enron has also closed on $1 billion worth of revolving credit lines with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) in the past week, with $450 million of that amount closed Monday. \nDevelopments with Enron, however, have raised enough concerns that energy companies aren't willing to extend themselves into positions that have even the appearance of vulnerability, Sanchez of Gelber & Associates said. \n\"The industry has been shell-shocked by their recent announcements, and they're not ready to go back to trading with them,\" said Sanchez of Gelber & Associates. \nSome traders wondered why Dynegy hasn't stepped in to buy energy from sellers and then sell that product to Enron. Such a move, known as \"sleeving\" in energy markets, serves as an ad hoc form of credit guarantee one transaction at a time. \nDynegy didn't return phone calls on the matter. \n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com \n(John Edmiston in Houston, Kristen McNamara in New York and Jon Kamp in Chicago contributed to this article.) \nReached later, Dynegy made clear it wouldn't take any extraordinary measures to support Enron in the market. \n\"We will operate as two separate companies until the merger is completed,\" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said. \"We have to act independently.\" \nMirant Corp. (MIR), a major trader of North American power and case, has trimmed its business with Enron. \n\"We're trading on a very limited basis,\" said spokesman Chuck Griffin, who wouldn't be more specific. \nCinergy Corp.

Dynegy said these regulations and the guaranteed cost recovery they entail led to unnecessary LNG investment in the early 1980s. The company argued that LNG imports should be treated as \"first sale\" gas over which the commission has no jurisdiction. \nDynegy announced the project in July and planned to begin receiving LNG shipments by the end of 2003. \nThe project involves converting an existing liquefied petroleum gas terminal and dock to receive LNG. Dynegy plans to convert an LPG tanker under construction to carry LNG instead by the targeted fourth-quarter 2003 start of operations, and it would seek additional LNG tankers in 2004. \nCompanies use LNG tankers and terminals to import gas from remote overseas gas fields in countries such as Algeria, Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela. The gas is frozen until it condenses into a liquid and is carried in specially designed double-hulled tankers. At import terminals it's turned back into gas and fed into the pipeline system. \nDynegy's Hackberry site is located about 22 miles southwest of Lake Charles, La., where CMS Energy Corp. (CMS) operates the only current LNG import terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast. \nChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX) holds a 26% stake in Houston-based Dynegy and plans to make a major new investment in the company to assist in its takeover of ailing energy company Enron Corp. (ENE). \nThe commission also denied an alternative Dynegy request for LNG import authority without conditions. \n\"We would have preferred a non-jurisdictional declaration, but we don't expect the FERC decision to have any impact on the viability of the project,\" a Dynegy spokesman said Tuesday. \nThe target of beginning LNG deliveries at Hackberry by the end of 2003 is unchanged, the spokesman said. \nThe company hasn't disclosed the cost of the project but says it will be less expensive than building from scratch because the site already has jetty and ship-berthing facilities. \nDynegy argued the history of CMS' Lake Charles import terminal shows why FERC regulation of LNG is a bad idea. \nAccording to Dynegy, when the Lake Charles terminal temporarily shut in 1983 after only one year of operation, U.S. gas customers were left paying more than $577 million over several years to cover the mothballed terminal's construction costs. That terminal has since resumed accepting LNG deliveries. \nIn a filing to the commission, Chevron supported Dynegy's case, arguing that LNG facilities are analogous to new gas fields that are outside FERC jurisdiction. \nBut other filings by BP PLC (BP), which supplies LNG to the U.S. from Trinidad and Tobago, and utility Atlanta Gas Light (ATG) made the case that FERC needs to retain regulatory oversight to ensure market stability. \nDynegy countered that BP might be biased by worries that an unregulated LNG terminal at Hackberry would reduce BP's current \"dominance\" in supplying LNG to the U.S. \n-By Campion Walsh, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9291; Campion.Walsh@dowjones.com\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Volume was more than double the second most-active issue, Xerox Corp. \n\"Everyone wants to sink the ship faster. This is a sell-off from yesterday's news which was hyped by the media,\" said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Michael Barbis. \nEnron warned in a U.S. Securities and Exchange filing released after markets closed on Monday that it could be forced by next week to pay $690 million in debt because of a credit downgrade on Nov. 12. \nThe filing made the stark statement that Enron would fail to be a \"going concern\" if a further credit cut forces it pay off $3.9 billion in debts to partnerships it is involved in. An early payoff of those debts would render Enron unable to service its revolving credit accounts, starting a downward spiral, it said. \nMeanwhile, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said that it may again cut Enron's BBB-minus rating, which could trigger those debt payoffs. But the agency said Enron's liquidity issues were unlikely to derail its merger with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. \nNEXT WEEK'S DEADLINE \nAnalysts said there were no surprising revelations in Enron's filing yesterday and that it should have no effect on plans by rival energy trader Dynegy Inc. to buy Enron. \n\"The facts have not changed so dramatically for the stock to be down this magnitude,\" Barbis said. \nOn Monday, Enron disclosed it is up against a Nov. 26 deadline, when it must deliver collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. \nIf not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. \nEnron is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. \n\"Enron has access to more than $3 billion in cash. They can pay off this note. They have cash coming in and are not illiquid,\" said Barbis. \"The timing of the note could have been better, but Enron keeps cash on hand for situations like this. This will not undermine the Dynegy deal.\" \nOn Monday, the Houston-based company also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share.\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\nRHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Chuck Kadlec is our guest host tracking the sell off. You know, the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) story you know has been in the headlines now for weeks. But it`s one of these cases where if you invest in a stock and you sort of buy into the story, it`s very difficult for some investors who now lost a lot of money. And everyday it seems there`s a new revelation there. How do you counsel people to sort of, you know, catch things that even some of the street don`t catch? \nCHARLES KADLEC, J&W SELIGMAN: Well, it`s obvious you can`t catch them because, if we could have, we would have. The best analysts on the Street missed this one. I think the real message here is the importance of diversification. And I think it also raises some important questions about corporate governance at Enron. And there, clearly, was something missing not only among the senior executive officers of that corporation but the board of directors as well.\nSCHAFFLER: In general, we`re seeing the markets just sort of retreat here. But it seems to be one of these sort of calm pullbacks we`ve talked so much throughout the show. The Dow started the day up better than 20 percent. \nThe Nasdaq up about 30 percent from the lows. \nAnd the one situation we`ve had when the markets pulled back, through those couple of weeks, is the buyers always come back in. We know that fund inflows were up in October. We also know October sometimes is when we see bottoms in markets. Just historically it seems that it happens in October. The data on the fund flows, does that intrigue you at all? \nKADLEC: Well, I think it`s just another of those straws in the wind, if you will. The leading economic indicators being up 0.3 percent today. I wouldn`t bet the ranch on that single number, but it`s positive, better than expected. Positive inflows suggest that fear, which was not only impacting the market, was clearly impacting the economy, starting to recede that`s a positive. \nAnd I think individual investors are beginning to look beyond the immediate news into next year. And, you know, we`ve had nine recessions. Up until now, we`ve had nine recoveries. We`re probably in the middle of the 10th recession. And we`re going to have a recovery. So, as people begin to try to size up the shape and the duration of that recovery, they`re beginning to, again, deploy their assets back into equities, which provide the best long-term returns of any asset class. \nSCHAFFLER: It`s interesting too because, you know, we`ve talked through the last couple of months it was always the cash on the sidelines. You know, we kept quoting how much was in money market funds just waiting to be deployed. Do you have any sense of how much momentum there is still to come into this market? How much money there might still be out there? Do you get the idea that the institutions as well as some retail customers might still be holding on to some money to re-deploy assets at this point? \nKADLEC: My sense is that-like at Seligman, for example, our teams are really focused on positioning the portfolios and to take advantage of the upturn that`s coming. So you`re seeing a move more toward cyclicals. Selecting really good companies that perhaps are oversold. \nWe`re also seeing horizons lengthen out a little bit. People beginning to think of what all of next year is going to look like. Really, very little attention to what`s happening in the fourth quarter of this year. We already know the economy`s in trouble. If anything, we`re set up for a positive surprise I think over the holiday season in terms of the consumer here. \nSCHAFFLER: Let`s find out exactly what`s going on now at the Big Board. \nWe know that stocks are moving lower. \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE) has been the country's most aggressive advocate of opening energy markets to competition, and Enron is now on the ropes, slated if all goes as planned to be absorbed by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN).\nBut industry observers said its demise won't open a leadership void in the regulatory battle. While Enron's efforts were critical in the early efforts to pry open markets, that work has largely been done, and there are now plenty of like-minded companies able step in, observers said. \n\"It is true that Enron has been a leader in pushing policies for a competitive market,\" said Linda Stuntz, a former top Energy Department official now with Stuntz, Davis & Staffier. \"But the news is they're not alone any more. There are a lot of others who will carry the flag.\" \nEnron, an object lesson in how the mighty have fallen, has been the industry's undisputed leader in pushing for competitive power markets at both the federal and state levels. The company is a dominant player in any policy debate before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and its positions weigh heavily as Congress debates electric industry reform legislation. \nLobbyists describe Enron's Washington office as \"huge,\" far surpassing that of Dynegy. \nEnron also had tremendous political clout. The company successfully backed top Texas regulator Pat Wood III for the FERC chairmanship earlier this year. Enron Chairman Ken Lay has been a key political backer of President George W. Bush, raising at least $100,000 for his campaign. The company itself contributed $114,000. \nEnron spent $2.4 million in the last federal election cycle, making it one of the nation's biggest political contributors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an advocacy group that monitors political campaign spending and influence. \n\"The company's contribution total for the 2000 elections more than doubled its political donations in each of the two previous election cycles,\" the center reports. \nBroad Support Seen For Markets \nNo company has come close to making Enron's commitment to shaping the laws and regulations that govern the energy industry. Still, industry observers see support for competitive energy markets even without Enron's largess. \n\"I think that there is a tremendous political will from all the leaders on all sides of Congress and the administration to move forward on electricity competition legislation,\" said Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. \"I don't the think the Enron situation is going to make any difference at all. \nOfficials with the two companies adamantly reject the premise that their merger will create a vacuum in the push for greater competition in the $220 billion electricity sector. \n\"Dynegy's going to continue to advocate open and competitive markets,\" spokesman Steve Stengel said. \"I can't speculate on what the new company is going to spend on lobbying efforts or what the combined entities' staff will look like. But clearly Enron and Dynegy share a belief in open and competitive markets, and the new entity will certainly continue to be vocal about opening markets to competition.\" \nRick Shapiro, Enron's managing director of global government affairs, echoed that view. He also said it was unlikely opponents of deregulation would succeed in using Enron's troubles as a reason not to further open markets. \n\"There will be companies that will try to use Enron's business problems as a reason to not move forward. But regulators will separate what happened to Enron from the rightness of the idea,\" Shapiro said. \"The validity of competition has been proven over and over again. This is not going to have a long-term effect.\" \nDynegy will probably inherit some of Enron's aggressiveness in lobbying, Stuntz said. \nState-Level View Mixed \nEnergy lawyers suggested that, in many respects, the public policy debate over competition has already been won. For instance, one-third of the power-generation capacity in the U.S. is now owned by companies other than the utilities that once enjoyed monopolies, Stuntz said. \n\"I'm not sure at the end of the day this really changes all that much,\" said William Scherman, a former FERC general counsel now with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. \"In Washington, vacuums don't exit very long.\" \nWhile the collective view is that nothing will change at the federal level, the view was mixed in terms of the ramifications for efforts to open retail markets to competition. \n\"More than any other company, Enron, on a national basis, has pushed for retail restructuring for gas and electricity,\" said Richard Meyers, senior regulatory counsel for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. \"Enron has had great credibility with state legislators and state regulators. If state legislators and regulators were interested in retail restructuring, Enron was there. But now, Enron is not there, or its credibility is in question. This, and the events in California, can only seem to further slow down retail restructuring.\" \nCalifornia's electricity crisis has certainly done plenty to blunt moves by states to open their retail electricity markets. And Congress hasn't had opening up retail markets on its front burner for several years now. \n\"If you're talking consumer choice and competition, that hasn't been a federal issue for so long,\" said Marc Yacker, a lobbyist for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, a group representing large industrial electricity users. \nBut in terms of the overall push for competition, Enron \"certainly has been the 800-pound gorilla,\" Yacker said. \"Whether there's a void remains to be seen.\" \n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Earlier\nthey touched $6.55, the lowest price in more than a decade.\nEnron's 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid as low as 69\ncents on $1 of face value and offered at 73 cents, down more than\n13 percent, traders said.\nEnron, whose dealings with affiliated partnerships led to\nearnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal investigation\nand a management shakeup, said in a regulatory filing that it has\nless than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to\ncomplete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders\nto restructure payment schedules to survive.\n``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial\nsituation,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who\nrates Enron shares ``hold'' and doesn't own them. ``They have to\nstay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks\ndifficult.''\nEnron and Dynegy spokespeople wouldn't comment on the stock\ndrop today. Standard & Poor's Investors Service said that Enron's\ncredit rating remained on negative watch, indicating it wouldn't\nimmediately downgrade the company's debt.\n$690 Million Surprise\n``Enron's near-term liquidity position is ... expected to be\nsufficient to carry the company through the completion of its\nproposed merger with Dynegy,'' S&P said in a report.\nInvestors were concerned the debt, including a $690 million\nnote that Enron disclosed it may have to pay off next week, would\nlead to a cut in Enron's credit rating, analysts said.\nThe filing was a ``distraction'' that will not threaten the\nmerger, said Todd Shipman, a director at S&P who follows Enron.\n``Our approach to this has been on the basis that the Dynegy\ndeal is a good thing for credit quality,'' Shipman said.\nMoody's Investors Service, which didn't issue a statement on\nEnron's debt today, kept the company's credit rating at investment\ngrade on Nov. 9, the day Dynegy announced it would buy Enron in a\ndeal now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt.\nThe ruling came after executives from Lehman Brothers\nHolding Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon\nSmith Barney lobbied the credit-rating company, people familiar\nwith the situation said.\nAvoiding Junk\nA junk rating would have led Dynegy to abandon the\nacquisition, Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson said.\nIt would also have triggered debt repayment of at least $3.9\nbillion, Enron said in a Securities & Exchange Commission filing\nyesterday.\nEnron shares are selling for almost 32 percent less than the\nvalue of Dynegy's offer, showing investors have doubts the deal\nwill be completed. Dynegy shares fell $1.90 to $41.70 today.\n``It's become more clear that the chances of this deal going\nthrough aren't 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,'' said\nEdward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6\nmillion Enron shares. ``There's just so much information that is\nunknowable'' about Enron's financial position, he said.\nMost of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of\nthe third quarter of 2002, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to\nclose, Enron said yesterday in a filing with the SEC.\nAsset Sales Planned\nLast week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said\nthe company will sell assets of ``non-core businesses'' to raise\nmoney. It has $8 billion invested in the businesses, including\nbroadband telecommunications and the Dabhol power plant in India.\nEnron expects to get ``billions'' from the sales, Whalley said,\nwithout being more specific.\nEnron reported yesterday that its U.S. operations had $1.2\nbillion in cash left. It has added at least $5 billion since Sept.\n30 from credit lines, loans and a $1.5 billion investment from\nChevronTexaco, part owner of Dynegy.\nEnron used $1.9 billion of the money it raised to retire\ncommercial paper, which is short-term debt. It gave no details on\nhow it spent the remaining $3.1 billion.\nEnron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said last week\nthat the company also was looking to get another $500 million to\n$1 billion from private investors.\nAsset sales valued at about $800 million are expected to\nclose by the end of this year, according to the SEC filing. Enron\nspokeswoman Karen Denne wouldn't comment on whether it could sell\nassets fast enough to keep current on its debts.\nDynegy will have to help Enron sell assets, said Mitchell\nStapley, who manages $3.5 billion in fixed-income assets including\nEnron bonds for Fifth Third Investment Advisors Inc.\nDynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of\nDynegy, also will have to help Enron negotiate with its lenders,\nsaid Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong\nAmerican Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares.\nDebt Questioned\n``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion) would be that large,\ncoming due all at once,'' Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question\ntheir decision to schedule it that way in the first place.''\nChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is\nproviding $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It\nprovided the first $1.5 billion a week ago. In exchange for that\ninvestment, Dynegy will get a pipeline valued at more than $2\nbillion if the Enron purchase is not completed.\nShares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $3.62\nto $86.53.\nEnron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a\nshare, bringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million. On\nNov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to\nreflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept\noff the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17\nmillion.\nA drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by\nStandard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690\nmillion note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee\nthe debt taken on by an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian\nnatural-gas assets, the filing said.\nWithout repayment or collateral, investors can begin to\nliquidate the partnership's assets, Enron said. The company said\nit's working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement\non the debt.\nMaking good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated\npartnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said.\nEnron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible\npreferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to\nwrite down its assets by $700 million, the filing said.\nDynegy's Watson said when the Enron buyout was announced that\nhe was convinced Enron's trading operations are sound, and he\ncalled disclosure about financial partnerships such as Whitewing\nas ``financial noise.'' He declined a request to comment today on\nEnron's latest filings, Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser said.\nEnron BBB- rating on CreditWatch negative - S&P\n11/20/2001\nAFX News\n(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd\nNEW YORK (AFX) - Standard & Poor's said its 'BBB-minus' and \"A-3\" ratings for Enron Corp will remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, which is one notch above junk status after the ailing energy group warned it may have to pay off a 690 mln usd note next week. \nIn a statement, the rating agency also said Enron's near-term liquidity position is \"expected to be sufficient\" to enable it to merge with Dynegy Inc, in a deal scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2002. \nYesterday, Enron warned that it faces heavy debt repayment obligations in less than 10 days, and has reduced its already-reported third-quarter earnings.\nIn a 10Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said that because of a credit rating downgrade last week, it now faces a debt payment of 690 mln usd by Nov 27. \nEnron also said it may have to pay 9.15 bln in debt due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy can be completed. \nThe group also restated its third-quarter earnings, lowering them by 3 cents per share. \nlwl/gc For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Many of these characteristics will be in the contract by definition but a number of these items can tend to be inconsistent across contracts. For maximum funding efficiency, the more homogenous the pool, the better.\n1. Clear events of default and prescribed remedies.\n2. Clear definition of termination events and process to terminate.\n3. Clear liquidated damages provisions upon termination.\n4. Firm quantity - take or pay type. We can monetize a requirements contract but will receive a haircut on the value of the deal.\n5. Demand charges/index premium contracts easier to monetize. Fixed price contracts require liquid hedging points to lock in the monetizable value.\n6. Clear definition of force majeure and permitted duration before contract either continues with LDs or terminates due to frustration.\n7. Availability of Business Interruption Insurance to cover losses during a FM event.\n8. Regulatory Outs Provisions - Prefer none.\n9. Severability clearly defined within the contract.\n10. Firm tenor - lenders lack of appetite for a term contract with annual evergreen provisions. If they are not legally obligated, little if any value.\n11. Volumetric Take Requirements - Are there make-up provisions for volumes paid for but not taken. If the counterparty didn't purchase the annual minimum, is there an immediate LD payment or does the party have three months for instance to make-up the deficiency.\n12. Ability to assign the receivables for financing purposes. Even better if we can assign the contract itself as security.\n13. Who is the credit? Is there credit support? Is it capped?\n14. Netting provisions. Prefer to have no netting or right of set-off to isolate the payment stream from the Enron estate. Typically, not possible and Enron has to indemnify for set-off claims.\n15. Prepayment provisions - Does the counterparty have the right to unilaterally early terminate? Monetization may incur make-whole damages upon a prepayment. Can we pass this cost through as a \"break\" cost of early unwind.\nThis is my quick cheat sheet of items I screen for. I've asked a few others to give me their thoughts as well and will append to the list. Thanks."}

Market participants always\nfind a\nway around the rules.\nThis week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided that it will\nhave\nto consider at its meeting next week revisions to its June 19 price\ncontrol\nruling. The initial price cap rule, set by the California Independent\nSystem\nOperator last spring, was only a few paragraphs long. Each successive\nprice cap\norder has gotten longer, though effectiveness still appears out of reach.\nThe\nFERC's April order was 28 pages long; the June order was 48 pages. And now\nadditional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes.\nThe revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the\nJune\norder. During a spell of very hot weather Monday, Sierra Pacific Resources\n(SRP)\nsubsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a\nsmall\nnumber of customers for 45 minutes. The company attributed the blackouts,\nin\npart, to the new price controls.\nSierra Pacific's chief spokesman, Paul Heagen, provided a bird's eye\nview of\nthe practical realities of the FERC's new price cap regime.\nPower Points: After having a few days to look into it, can you say that\nprice\ncaps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday?\nPaul Heagen: Yes, but first let me say that all of it was unintentional.\nFERC\nwas trying to do the right thing. Price caps were a noble effort to solve\na real\nproblem in California.\nBut on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function. It had\nneither,\nand that can be attributed to the price caps. Normally, in one or two\nphone\ncalls we could have got what we needed. On Monday, we were five to six\ncalls\ninto it and still on the phone.\nPrice caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other\nstates into\nthe California morass. We have this artificial environment which we are\nall\ntrying to sort through.\nPP: How, specifically, are the caps having this effect?\nPH: There are a couple of elements. The 10% premium for power sold to\nCalifornia is supposed to reflect concerns about credit. That 10% in an\nopen\nmarket is no big deal, but in a constrained situation the seller will grab\nit,\nbecause now it's his only chance to make money.\nAlso, the way this is set up, they look backwards. They determine the\nprice\nafter the fact. I can't think of any business in the world where you sell\na\nproduct and find out later what price you sold at.\nThis had a very chilling effect on people's willingness to sell.\nNormally, a\ncloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in the\nreal-time market. Normally, those little 50-megawatt packets move pretty\neasily,\nand that's really important for maintaining reliability.\nWith the price cap, utilities hunkered down. Selling at $92 wasn't worth\nthe\nrisk. They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it.\nAlso, we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share\nsavings\nwith customers who agree to curtail use. If the market is, say, $500, we\nmight\npay them $250/MWh to curtail demand. But in a $92/mkt, we can offer them\nsuch a\nsmall amount of money that they stay on.\nPP: Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price\ncontrols?\nPH: We've had a senior team in Washington, D.C., at the FERC since last\nweek.\nRight away we saw another effect of the FERC order: It penalizes companies\nlike\nours that signed long-term supply contracts before the order because many\nof\nthose deals were done at prices above the price cap.\nThe biggest issue for us, is, did FERC really mean to penalize companies\nlike\nus that planned ahead? It's long-term contracts that provide price\nstability.\nIt's unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for long-term\ncontracts\nthat have been undercut by price caps. If we get into a situation where we\nhave\na little extra to sell, now we can't recover our costs.\nPP: With such high prices the past year, a lot of small, oil-fired\nturbines\nhave been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer. Traders\nfor\nother southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have\nbeen\nvery helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year, but they weren't\navailable this week because they cost more to run than the price cap. Did\nyou\nsee the same thing?\nPH: We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe\narea in\nthe last few months. They were supposed to provide peak power, but they\nget\nuneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme.\nYou know, we've tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the\nCalifornia situation and behave very independent of how California\nbehaves. So\nNevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effect\noutside of California. We were able to minimize the impact on our\ncustomers\nMonday, but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on\nthe\nimpact of price caps.\n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;\nmark.golden@dowjones.com\n(END) DOW JONES NEWS  07-06-01\n03:14 PM- - 03 14 PM EDT 07-06-01"}

It\nis currently divided among 3 POIs.\n( 50 MW at Chelan/RRH, 50 MW at\nSlatt/Boardman, and 70 MW at the\nUS/Canadian Border.)  The POD is\nAlcoa substation, near Vanalco's\nfacility.  Without a notice for\nchange in these points, the demand\nwould have to be used on a nonfirm\nbasis.  The value, of course, would\nbe in the discounted price you could\nachieve for the demand.  If you have\na high load factor usage, it may be\nvery economical.\nVanalco would consider offers\nconsistent with the secondary\ntransmission market, subject to the\nprocess they are going through in\nthe courts, but their objective is\nto preserve the asset for the\nfuture.\nThe term of the contract begins Oct\n1, 2001 and terminates Sept 30, 2002\n(1 year), but rollover rights exist\nwhich have some value.  They would\nexpect some recall rights in the\nevent of production at the smelter,\nbut the notice period could be a\nnumber of months.  Let me know what\nyou think.

It leaves the \nability for the Commission to extend to 2003 if in the public interest.

Provides an opt-in provision for large commercial/agricultural/industrial \ncustomers with an annual true-up.\nThe sense I got was that CMTA/CLECA may have asked for this.

Provides that overcollections of PPA/QFs/SONGs will be used to offset \nundercollections of cap.\nOur comment is that the overcollections, on a pro-rata basis will be used to \noffset the cap.  All customers pay stranded costs associated with those \ncontracts, all customers should receive stranded benefits.\n4.  SDG&E is still subject to reasonableness review by the Commission.

{"id": "5703", "contents": "Re: Cuiaba Call--legal issues\nBecause we may want to go to the local court to get an injunction or TRO or \nwhatever they call it in Brazil to force Furnas to sign.  Tozzini tells us we \ncan do it in a couple of weeks, in the federal court, but Bob we know the \nhistory on that in the other case.  I'm not in favor of it particularly, but \nthe Tozzini lawyers have presented it as an option for consideration.\nRobert C Williams\n02/02/2001 07:34 AM\n\nBruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Richard B Sanders@ECT \n\nI want to get involved in this.  Michelle will bring me up-to-date.  I don't \nunderstand why we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration.\nMichelle Blaine\n02/01/2001 07:36 PM\n\nLundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Richard B Sanders@ECT, Robert \nC Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\n1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) \nreported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's \nletter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to \nsign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There \nare initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows \nwhose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it \nis not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask \nour Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  \nKeep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, \nElectronorte. \n2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the \nambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, \nWinston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political \navenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, \nhowever, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek \nassistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political \nbattle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to \nseek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to \nprogress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has \nexpired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong \nmessage and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we \nproceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 \nof the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at \nthe end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little \ntime, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate \nproceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what \nreaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure \nhow that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the \ncommercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure \nwhat rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may \naffect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look \nat under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or \nexpress waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would \nadvise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with \nrespect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand \nevery possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix \ndeveloped already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own \nway.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have \ntraditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who \nrepresents them. \n3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE \ndoes not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the \ncontract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm \ntold we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that \nwe were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine \nPowell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our \nforce majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our \nposition.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both \nparties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  \nI'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.\n4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration \nconcern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what \nit will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. \nDarren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to \nconsider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of \nproposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a \nnumber to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It \nneeds to be subject to review as we go along.\n5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going \nto get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and \nget a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best \nadvice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the \nBrazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so \nI am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in \nthe court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position \nthat we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.\nPlease give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. \nJohn Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I \nmay be unaware of with any strategic plan.\nRegards,\nMichelle"}
{"id": "6223", "contents": "Lupe\nKristie,\nHello. How are you? What are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. It has been a while to say the least, but the other day Brendan and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough). I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.  Brendan said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.  I hope you don't mind.  \nAnyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.  I began trading power about a year and a half ago for Enron.  I now manage the  west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San Francisco, right?)...  \nMy job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Art Museum.  The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.  It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.  It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.  The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.  The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.\nSo, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.\nTake care.\nBill"}

{"id": "8336", "contents": "COP-7 Update -- 11/08\nCOP-7 Update - November 8 \nThe negotiations continue today, in closed sessions, and aim to conclude tomorrow afternoon. The following key sticking points remain and have been sent to Ministers for final resolution:\nFungibility of emissions allowances, and credits generated under Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism.  Enron strongly supports full fungibility among allowances and credits.\nThe nature of compliance rules under the market-based mechanisms still need to be agreed upon. Specifically, whether the eligibility requirements to participate in the mechanisms are deemed as mandatory and whether parties that wish to use the mechanisms must agree to the compliance rules under Protocol.  Enron supports strong compliance rules and eligibility criteria, but urges that once a credit generating project has been approved by oversight bodies (CDM Executive Board; JI Supervisory Body) that the credits are secure (assuming no project-oriented defaults).\nSinks - 1) how sinks allowances will be able to be used in the first commitment period, 2008 - 2012 (hierarchy of credit submission). The Bonn Agreement stated that sinks allowances could not be banked.  The European Union seeks agreement on the order of submission of all credits used for compliance in the first commitment period.  2) Russia's request for an increase in its domestic sinks allocation in the first budget period.  The European Union has the most problem with increasing Russia's allocation and is working bilaterally with Russia to resolve this issue.  From an Enron perspective, the amount of Russian sinks allowances will likely impact prices and demand for greenhouse gas emissions allowances and credits, especially in the first commitment period. \nThe nature and scope of what must be reported by national governments is still being debated.  Many of these are technical issues, but are important to ensure the integrity of the emissions trading system and tracking of national compliance with treaty obligations.\nOf note, the oversight body of the Clean Development Mechanism, the Executive Board, has been largely appointed and is set to meet tomorrow afternoon.  Some of the countries represented as full members include Brazil, Costa Rica, Morocco, and Antigua and Barbuda. Amb. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), a leader of this process (and good contact), will likely be elected to serve as the President of Executive Board.\nAmb. Raul Estrada (Argentina), the man largely associated with hammering out the Kyoto Protocol, has been appointed to serve as a Chair of one of the key implementing bodies of the Conference of the Parties.  His leadership in the process is important as we work with TGS on greenhouse emission reduction projects. \nUnder Secretary Paula Dobriansky made a formal statement to the conference plenary last night.  Of significance, it said that the science on climate change was uncertain, which was criticized in the hallways by many delegations and observers. \nThe U.S. delegation will meet with industry twice today.\nThe Pew Center on Global Climate Change has posted a good outline of some of the key issues to be resolved at COP-7, please take a look at it if you would like additional background or feel free to send me an email.\nhttp://www.pewclimate.org/cop7/update_110601.cfm\nAgain, if you would like to contact me please try via email or call me at +41793453046.\nAll the best,\nLisa"}

If\nso, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on\nmy voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the\nscope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG\nand the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power\nmodel).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short\nterm NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the\nmoment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and\nterm, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,\ngas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,\nbank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can\nexpect to see enter and which are dogs.\nI really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually\nproductive direction again.

He has missed the past two games while recovering from his second arthroscopic surgery this year. \nOlandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/24/01\nGary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game. \nDarnay Scott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01\nScott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week. \nJames Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01\nWith Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. \nAnthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin! Updated 11/23/01\nAccording to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. \nEmmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01\nSmith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. \nDamon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01\nThe Jacksonvil! le! Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. \nJames Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01\nStewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. \nCharlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01\nBatch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain. \nTony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01\nBanks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. \nRod Smith <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01\nSmith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. \nTerrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01\nDavis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.\nOlandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&> , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01\nGary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. \nJeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nGraham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.\nJerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01\nThe loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.\nCurtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01\nExpect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.\nKordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nWhile the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.\nDarrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01\nJackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.\nTim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01\nRaiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.\nCharlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\nDavid Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01\nPatten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.\nTroy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01\nBrown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.\nAntowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01\nSmith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.\nOronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01\nGadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.\nJames McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.\nTravis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01\nThe Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.\nTony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01\nGonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of ! a ! disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.\nStephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01\nDavis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. \nLarry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\nTony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01\nRichardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.\nMore Updates

{"id": "1314", "contents": "RE: Western Frontier update\nI spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. \nWilliams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.\nIf the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.\nCall if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.\n\nAre they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?\n\nMark,\nSteph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  \nI glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:\nMarathon - 75,000 dth/d\nWilliams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d\nUtilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d\nEntergy - 75,000 dth/d\nWith the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  \nLet me know if you need anything else.\nPhil\n\nPhil, \nHere is the information that you requested.

In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.\nI am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.\nENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.\nRay\n<Embedded StdOleLink>"}

{"id": "883", "contents": "FW:\nMartin, Lance\nWhat do you think?\nVince\n\nI've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse\nthe nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.\nI just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure\nthis is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain\nwhy.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk\nmore about this.\nFirst, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing\nand specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM\nimplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility\nand reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the\nPJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a\n%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems\nis out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact\nthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)\nThen the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting\nsoftware to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat\nunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the\nPJM ISO decides what prices it would like\nfor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not\na transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy\nthe risk management services that Enron provides.  The\nonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is\nthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area\nto meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the\nimports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.\nHowever, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the\nEast Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports\nto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at\nthe discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service\nmitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.\nIt effectively kills off the development of risk management at\nthe wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less\nprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated\nprices.\nIn short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative\nform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces\nprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just\nget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service\nregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service\nmitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service\nprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.\nAs we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources\nof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side\ninvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A\nnecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect\nactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power\nexercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market\nparticipants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM\nmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving any\nsignificant benefits to consumers or energy traders.\nFrank"}

To that end and as a part of ETS's on-going \ntransition of merging  ETS's and EOTT's Operations, I am pleased to announce \na realignment of ETS Operations Technical Services.  \nThe purpose of these changes is to better align our technical resources with \nthe new Operations Areas and teams and better serve their needs.  Therefore, \nwe will form Area Technical Support Teams for each of the Technical \ndisciplines (Corrosion, Measurement and Controls & Electrical):  \nMax Brown, Director of Corrosion Services, will lead the Corrosion teams.\nKenneth Cessac, Director of Measurement Services, will have responsibility \nfor the Measurement Support teams.\nKen Crowl, Director of Controls and Electrical Services will provide \nleadership to the C&E teams.  \nSteve Klimesh, Business Consultant, will provide on-going support to ETS on \nUAF and other continuous improvement initiatives.   \nThe Clifton and Beaver machines shops will remain a part of OTS as we \ncontinue to grow the Enron Machine and Mechanical Services business.  \nThe attached organizational charts show the new Tech Services.  The vacancies \nreflected on the charts are an effort to shore up our technical support staff \nfor operating the EOTT assets.  In the coming weeks, our Technical Support \nTeams will be further defining their support roles to the Region and team \nlevel and working diligently to fill these vacancies.  Any thoughts or \ncomments that you might have regarding these changes are certainly \nappreciated.  Please feel free to call me or any of the OTS Directors with \nyour feedback or for assistance.  Our goal is to continue to provide the best \nservice possible to you, our customers."}

Lets see what Steve Schneider has to say\nBonnie White@ENRON\n07/06/2000 07:07 PM\n\nRichard,\nI am forwarding an e-mail that I received today from Durango Petroleum re the \nCollins matter in Hardin County.  I spoke with the company president today.  \nHe believes that they do not have any exposure but would like to settle the \nmatter as they believe it will cost them more than $5000 to hire counsel to \ndefend it.  I told him that I did not believe that HPL would be inclined to \npay $5000 to settle the case, but that I would pass along his request.  I am \nconcerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a \nyear ago to remove the pipe/valve.  I asked him if he had any correspondence \nor other evidence of that .  He will check and get back to us.  Lisa \nRobichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its \nfile placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land.  \nIf we received notice and ignored it, we may want to consider contributing to \na settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove \nintentional trespass.  However, I still believe that Collins will have a \ndifficult time proving any actual damages.  We need to be cautious about not \ngetting into a situation in which Durango/IP Petroleum would end up helping \nCollins to prove his case.  \nEileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two \nweeks.  We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August \n17.  Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial.  He \nsent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories/requests for \nproduction along with the notice of trial setting.  Lisa Robichaux will work \nwith John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information.  We also intend \nto send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return \n(July24).  In the meantime, if you agree, I intend to file a motion for \ncontinuance since Durango would like one, Collins did not give us notice of \nhis request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding/honeymoon.  \nHowever, we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not \ngranted.  I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you \nhave any questions.

My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked \nin with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the \ncalls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due \nto the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am \nworking on so I do try to clear the box daily.\n(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan \nyou need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that \nyou get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on \nvacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That \nway we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although \nI am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much \nabout where I keep particular files or documents.  \n(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt \nuncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have \nchosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  \n(The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment \nacross the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My \ngetting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my \npresence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  \nEqually important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as \nshe has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only \nanswered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I \nthink they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions \nwith my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or \nsick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that \nour department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide \nin an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not \nrequired.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for \nsome justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to \nrely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the \ninformation you are getting is accurate.\nCheryl Nelson\nSenior Counsel\nEB3816\n(713) 345-4693\nhttp://gss.enron.com/\nSara Shackleton@ECT\n05/21/2001 10:55 AM\n\n(increase from USD25 Million to USD100 Million) in favor of Bear, Stearns, et \nal\nCheryl:\nThanks.  \nAlso, please note that while you were away:\n(1)  Your voice mailbox was full.\n(2)  Keegan was immediately advised if we needed a file that could not be \nlocated.\nSara Shackleton\nEnron North America Corp.\n1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a\nHouston, Texas  77002\n713-853-5620 (phone)\n713-646-3490 (fax)\nsara.shackleton@enron.com\nCheryl Nelson@ENRON\nSent by: Cheryl Nelson@ENRON\n05/21/2001 10:36 AM\n\n(increase from USD25 Million to USD100 Million) in favor of Bear, Stearns, et \nal\nSara: \nI will forward the documents to you.  \nFor future reference, if anyone is looking for a file for an urgent matter \nwhile I am out, she should convey that fact to me by either (1) leaving a \nvoice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to \nspeak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will \ncontact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on \nFriday.\nCheryl Nelson\nSenior Counsel\nEB3816\n(713) 345-4693\nhttp://gss.enron.com/\nSara Shackleton@ECT\n05/15/2001 03:45 PM\n\nfrom USD25 Million to USD100 Million) in favor of Bear, Stearns, et al\nCheryl:\nI spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution \nas the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.

Since you will\nneed a methodology to work around missing information, the new forms have\ncodes that will allow you to enter\nundefined PTIDs and undefined new participants.\nPTID number 999999 is used for a resource that has not been assigned a\nnumber.\nNewLSE is used for a new Load Serving Entity that has not been assigned a\n\"Registrant Name\"\nNewSuppl is used for a new Supplier that has not been assigned a\n\"Registrant Name\"\nNOTE that if you use any of the above, you must describe your intentions in\nthe comments cell of the form being submitted.\nOther Changes\nISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of\nNYISO transactions during the supplemental\nprocess.  The supplemental process is implemented when there is\ninsufficient UCAP available within a location and\nthe NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortage\nhas occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.\nPTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO\nauction have been assigned.  The PTID\nnumbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental\nprocesses.   For example, a participant who is\nselling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction\nwould enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when\nselling into a subsequent ISO auction.\nA list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the\nauction Offer forms.\nReminder\nWhen identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in\nterms of the procurement period for the first auction\nmonth when the transaction took place.  For example, on May 15 (the auction\nfor the upcoming months of June through October)\n3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.  The auction\nreference that you will use for both the June and\nAugust transactions are ISOMoJun.  The same auction reference would be used\nif on May 15, the transactions were for\nAugust and September.\nWhen completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.  Lets say\nthat you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip\nAuction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.  Your\nentries on the form would show the 25 MW strip\nauction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW\nbilateral transaction.

{"id": "2982", "contents": "FW: Enron Concerns about JavaSoft\nScott McNealy at Sun asked us to send in an e-mail to him our issues with JavaSoft.  Mike took a shot at it and a draft is below.  It has not gone to him yet but we should get him something soon.\nMy comments are that the draft below is very accurate but is too long and detailed for a CEO and the last paragraph, thought factual, will change.\nCan you please give me your comments so I can get back with Mike and Jay and finish something and send it to Scott?\nThanks.\nGP\n\n------------------\nScott,\nEnron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.\nEnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.\nWe firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.\nAs an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  \nThe fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.\nMy primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.\nSolutions:\nCreate a separate, distinct, and equally influential body in JavaSoft including ONLY large end-user customers (Power Users).  A good first list would include Enron, Charles Schwab, GE, and E-Bay.\nCreate an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.\nEnsure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.\nRethink EJBs.\nIf you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.\nRegards,\nMichael Guadarrama\nDirector, E-Commerce Application Development\nEnron Net Works, LLC."}

On behalf of ABAG, I would  like to solicit your support of this petition.  The decision in question is  the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for the  three-cent rate increase.  \nYou may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all  bundled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did  not recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of  D.01-03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.  You also  know that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT to  be subject to the rate increase. \nThe ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  that DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between the  two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if they were  subsequently returned to bundled service.  The arguments supporting this  position are as follows:\nDirect  access customers were specifically exempted from the procurement-related rate  increase because they do not receive procurement service.  They should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month procurement surcharge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled service.   \nThe inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under significant financial stress.  The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme financial hardship.   The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge has added to that  burden unnecessarily.\nIn a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),  the Commission has expressed  its intent to \"guard against inequities\" for direct access customers of  SDG&E.  ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford similar protection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not receive bundled procurement service during the  interval between the March and May Decisions.  \nMoreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the procurement surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be discriminatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the anti-discrimination provisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(a) and 453(c).\nABAG POWER  would very much appreciate the support of ESPs and other market participants at  the Commission.  Under Rule 47(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and  Procedure, \"Responses to petitions for modification must be filed and served  within 30 days of the date that the petition was served, unless the  administrative law judge sets a different date. Responses must be served on the  petitioner and on all  parties who were served with the petition and must  comply with the requirements of Rules 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5.\"  Filings  sooner than that would be appreciated.  Please give me a call or email if  you are willing to file in support of the ABAG petition.  Thanks very  much for your consideration of our request.\nDan\nLaw  Offices of Daniel W.

Great time to take pot shots at everything we do for these guys!\n\n[mailto:djcustomclips@djinteractive.com]\n\nEnron offline.\n08/17/2001\nEnergy Compass\n(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved\nEnron CEO Jeff Skilling quit this week at a time when the company has problems\nin almost every geographic region and business sector in which it operates.\nIts once-vaunted broadband business is in the dumps, and the Dabhol power\nproject, at one time the prize example of foreign investment in India, has\nturned into a debacle (EC Jul.13,p4). The company recently withdrew\nmysteriously from two high-profile Middle East gas ventures, including a stake\nin one of three Saudi projects (EC Jun.15,p5). Just last week, an explosion\ntook down its Teeside power plant in the UK, killing three workers (EC\nAug.10,p9), and its internet-based trading service, EnronOnline, suffered a\nmorning-long outage. California has issued virtual \"wanted posters\" for the\ncompany and its execs for allegedly causing the state's electricity crisis.\nThe stock has tracked the downfall. Just a year ago, Enron was trading at more\nthan $90/share. It was recently hovering around $42, and has dropped since\nSkilling's announcement below $40. Not even the 22nd consecutive quarter of\nrecord earnings, issued last month, helped. Sharks could now start circling\nthe waters. Several years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell made overtures, apparently\ndrawn by access to Enron's massive North American gas and power marketing\nbusiness and gas pipeline system. When nothing came of the talks, Shell bought\nTejas Energy. The Shell rumors have now resurfaced - and Enron investors might\nbe prepared to listen this time round.\nAlthough the stock price decline began on the watch of once and again chief\nexecutive Ken Lay, it accelerated once Skilling assumed the post in February\nas Lay headed to Washington to become part of President George W. Bush's\nunofficial advisory team. Skilling's move also coincided with the overall\nslide in all tech stocks, but termination of a highly touted broadband\npartnership with Blockbuster Video accelerated the decline.\nThough Skilling says he left for personal reasons, reports that some board\nmembers were unhappy with his performance had been circulating for weeks. Nor\nis Skilling the only one to jump Enron's troubled ship. Rebecca Mark, once\nviewed as a possible rival to Skilling, \"resigned\" last summer because of the\npoor performance of Enron's Azurix water business. Joe Sutton, who headed\nEnron's international business, left last autumn over a difference in\nstrategy. Sutton supported investments in hard assets, while Enron's business\nmodel now is \"asset light.\" More recently, vice chairman Cliff Baxter and Lou\nPai, who headed the retail energy unit, have departed, and Ken Rice, once the\ngolden boy of broadband, is reportedly leaving.\nLay assured analysts after Skilling's announcement that Enron would continue\nthe strategy of building up its trading operations and operating with a\nminimum of assets. Based on the past year's stock performance, it might be\nbetter to head in another direction.\nFolder Name: Rahil Jafry\nRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 82\n______________________________________________________________________\nTo review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered.  I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.  \nSecond, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions.  It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone.

{"id": "450", "contents": "Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity\nConsumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity \nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. \nThe Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies\nWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,\" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. \"If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void.\" \nThree weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. \n\"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,\" Ahern said. \"It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover.\" \nThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. \nThe Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. \nThe California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. \nThe CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \nCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report."}

We should not be giving the fundy web data to the estate.\n\nLloyd and Tim H,   There is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the Enron Estate.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read,\ncopy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify the\nsender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.\nThank you.\n_______________________________________________________________\nDavid: Here are my comments re the Agency Agreement draft sent last week:\n(1) Section 1.27. I would suggest replacing \"in Peoples' sole discretion\"\nwith \"in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2\". This is more consistent\nwith the intent re changes to the Operating Statement. (2) Section 2.4.\nEach one of the new provisions re nominations, (a) 1,2, and 3, ends with a\nsimilar sentence: \"Peoples will confirm these requests as soon as\npracticable prior to such nimination deadline and shall enter any\nnominations necessary by such nomination deadline.\" Should this be more\nspecific, perhaps something like : \"Peoples will confirm acceptance of\nthese requests as soon as practicable prior to the nomination deadlione and\nshall schedule such nominations prior to the dealdine.\"? (The wording for\nno. 3 is similar to 1 and 2.)   (3) Section 2.9 (ii) From a regulatory\nperspective, I prefer the bracketed language. As I noted regarding the last\ndraft, a regulator would be concerned with an agreement commiting only to\n\"commercially reasonable efforts\" re compliance with the GTC, or a Law or\nJudgment. (4) Section 2.10. There is a typo in the second line from the\nbottom of 8, it's \"remains\" unpaid, not \"remain\". (note that this concept\nof a Peoples credit policy is consistent with Peoples' rights re denial of\nserivice under Section 8.2 of the GTC, which allows Peoples to refuse\nservice based on a credit analysis.) (5) Section 5.1. At the time of the\nlast draft, we discussed an additional representation for Peoples that \"it\nhas provided MEH with a copy of the G&TC in effect as of the Effective\nDate\". This could inserted in 5.1 as (d), with a relettering of current d\nand e. (6) Section 7.2 I don't think the second to last sentence will work.\nThis says that, if Peoples rejects an offered Extended Hub Transactions or\ndoesn't timely accept, it can't enter into a similar transaction with the\nparty involved for 6 months. The problem with this is that Peoples must\nprovided Hub Service under the GTC, except when a ground for refusal stated\nin Section 8.2 of the GTC applies. The circumstances described in 7.2 are\nnot a legitimate ground for refusal. I beleive, however, that we get to the\nsame place if 7.2 were modified to require that Peoples pay MEH its\npercentage of Cumulative Net Revenues in the event that a transaction\nsimilar to one previously rejected for the same party is accepted within 6\nmos. after termination of the Agency Agreement.  (7) Section 8.3.  Item\n(vi) of the list of functions could be expanded to state: \"assisting in the\npareparation and filing of requests for Governmental Approval in accordance\nwith Section 10.1 and/or the preparation of FERC reports that are required\nin the ordinary course of business and not specifically requested by FERC.\"\nI wan't sure of the intent re the last phrase of this. Does this mean that\nif a Report is specifically requested by FERC, MEH would be paid separetly\nfor work on the Report? I would have thought that routine review of\nregulatory filings and work on reports might all fall into the category\ncovered by the $50,000 payment, regardless of whether a particular report\nis requested. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks"}

{"id": "763", "contents": "FW: LADWP Gas Contract\nJeff-can you review this and let me know what you think.  Please initial and send back if you think it's ok as is.  Plsease advise by Nov 5. Thank you.\n\nDear Potential Gas Supplier\nAs some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement\nwill come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current\ncommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to\nuse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening\nis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing\ndelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.\nWe are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City\nCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of\nagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by\nthe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our\nBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep\nus operating.\nI've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are\ndoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed\ncontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,\nif it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new\nyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be\ncomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any\nchanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the\navailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we\nhave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our\nboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying\nto do here.\nI Hope most of you will respond.

{"id": "2754", "contents": "RE: Draft Letter to Congress on Wynn Reliability Legislation\nCongressman DeLay is with us.....but with the demise of Speaker Gingrich, the \nrole of Committee Chairman has been reinstated.  Thus, this to-be Chairman is \ngoing straight to the Speaker which poses both a political and House Rules \nconundrum.  Of course, we are also going to the Speaker, the Majority Leader, \netc.  But it becomes the \"pet rock\" game where one Member respects another \nMember's \"pet rock\" so that Member respects his \"pet rock.\"  The one \noutstanding pressure point we retain is lame-duck Chairman Bliley who is on \nour side yet his relationship with the Leadership is poor while Congressman \nTauzin's remains stellar.  You might recall that Congressman Tauzin switched \nparties with the price tag being many bennies and \"secret deals\" from \nLeadership.  As of today, Congressman Barton is also on our side (but with \nthe death of his brother, his mother's open heart surgery, his wife's breast \ncancer scare, etc.) we have not gotten him to refocus on approaching \nCongressman Tauzin yet.  I will do this at the appropriate time.  I have kept \nEd Buckham apprised of our strategies.\nRichard Shapiro@EES\n08/10/2000 07:08 PM\n\nWhere's Delay?\nCynthia Sandherr@ENRON\n08/10/2000 05:50 PM\n\nRick:  unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a \n\"reasonable chance of passing.\"  To block this possibility, we are pursuing \ntwo strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message \nthat the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political \ninoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the \ntechnical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If \nthe bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered \"consensus\" \notherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is \nstill lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for \nreasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would \nimprove the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of \ncourse, we cannot be obvious on this approach.  \nPart of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with \nCongressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House \nLeadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to \"politically inoculate \nRepublicans.\"  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he \ncarries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give \nCongressman Tauzin the same message.\nAnd our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue \ndissipates.....and/or they run out of time......\nRichard Shapiro@EES\n08/10/2000 09:16 AM\n\nWhy are we communicating technical problems ?( do we think it has a \nreasonable chance of passing?)

Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter \nwent through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a \nlarger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a \nstronger message with a multitude of signatures.\nThe status of the letter is that it is being \"held in our back pocket\" should \nit become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an \n\"almost\" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let \nme know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the \ngroup.  \nOn a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a \nshort white paper to detail the \"technical problems\" still remaining with the \nWynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's \nopposition and lack of bill \"consensus\" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this \npaper is ready.)  I believe ELCON, EPSA and CMA will continue to share our \nopposition although confusion remains on the Hill as to the exact reasons for \nour opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating.  \nthanks.\n- 08_04_00_Draft_Stake_ltr_WJL.doc"}

{"id": "6117", "contents": "FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel\nRTO Week\n<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\nDay 4 - October 18, 2001\nAfternoon Session\nStandardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices \nPanelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.\nGeneral Observations\nThe Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. \nFERC Deliverables\nA great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  \nThe first major topic was \"How many RTOs?  What is their scope?\"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.\nThe next topic was, \"What will be standard market design?\"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.\nThe commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, \"Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?\" and, \"How much detail do you need us to provide?\"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should \"Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.\"  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  \nOne item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the \"RTO Design and RTO Implementation\" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:\n?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?\n?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (\"covered\" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both \"covered\" and \"uncovered\" schedules are allowed)? \n?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?\n?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?\n?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?\n?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?\n?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?\n?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?\nHopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., \"do congestion management\") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., \"LMP with financial hedging instruments\") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.\nNow for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, \"My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.\"  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.\nNERC and GISB\nA great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, \"Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?\"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the \"new\" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.\nBrownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.\nMennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed \"successes,\" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these \"successes\" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.\nThere was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.\nThe arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771"}

The rally was \nsponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. \n\"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it \nempowers us,\" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports \nAuthority director. \"It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic \ncommunity made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.\" \nGeorge Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team \nis actively courting the Hispanic community. \nThe pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, \nand Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a \nrepeat of the 1999 referendum. \nVoters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports \nauthority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and \ncounty to oversee and develop sports venues. \nThe Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one \nmade four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share \nthe new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. \nThe team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood \nimprovement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit \norganizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets \nthe Hispanic community, Postolos said. \nThe new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, \nincluding City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario \nGallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. \nVasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is \ngetting more tangibles this time around. \nHe said, \"When you consider that our community will get 30 percent \naffirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth \noutreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this \nis a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the \nHispanic community.\" \nMercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, \nheard the details of the plan for the first time. \n\"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild \nthe community,\" she said. \"We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.\" \nHumberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, \nwas critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. \n\"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay \nraises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for \nrich entrepreneurs,\" Barrera said. \nRichard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told \nattendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. \nSergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the \nlack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos \nacknowledged that the team needs to do better. \nTVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln\nBy Bryan Lee\n10/16/2000\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nOF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \nWASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in \na U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power \nmarketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales \ncontract. \nTVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its \ndistribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen \nexpenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its \ndebt-reduction forecast. \nAccording to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged \nbreach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year \n2000. \nTVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is \nunder a court protective order. \n\"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,\" said \nDavid Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on \nthe line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility \ncustomers. \nBut after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the \nsubject of the claim. \nTVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment \norder from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, \nstemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman \nsaid Monday. \nIn March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of \ncontract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. \nBut the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to \nelaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA \nsaid Enron sought the court seal. \nThe dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based \nenergy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest \nU.S. power producers. \nThe relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to \nthe lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes \nduring hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. \nAfter the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between \n$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - \nEnron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only \nunconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. \nTVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were \nspiking upward. \nEnron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on \nthe volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access \nacross TVA's system. \nAfter the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron \nbegan complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by \nfailing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service \nrequests. \nA TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement \nover the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. \nBut the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public \nwith its complaints about TVA's transmission service. \nIn February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson \nasking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its \nown power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's \nrequests were gathering dust. \nEnron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its \ntransmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones \nNewswires, 202-862-6647, \nbryan.lee@dowjones.com\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The obligation was retired on September 28, 2001.  I believe Tana has all of the relevant documentation relating to that deal.

The standard duration for a short term might be day to day or one month or less and the long term would be any trade over 30 days.  In an effort to get started, the ideal contract to utilize would be the \"GISB\" contract, which stands for Gas Industry Standard Board.  It's just a standard boiler plate contract that \"the Board\" (comprised of reps from various pipelines, marketing companies, LDC's etc.) put together.  It's widely accepted!  Just double-check on the firmess of the contract.\nWhat is the usual process going from short to longer term\ncontracts?\nAnswer: There is no process, it just depends on what type of trade your end-use customer desires.\nCan you describe to me in detail what a typical exemplary\ntrade is like?\nAnswer: A trade in which all facts/risks were clearly and accurately represented/communicated and the price is commensurate with the type of trade you are providing (i.e. firm or interruptible).\nWhat is the problem that most marketers make with traders?\nAnswer: Misrepresentation, if you don't know and you are not sure, please communicate this to your potential buyer.  There is nothing wrong with arranging a conference call with you supplier and end-use customer.  We do it all the time, and we don't go around you.  Oftentimes, it gives the end-use customer a comfort level, that an experienced, reputable company is backing you. \nI appreciate your time and you tell me when it's a good\ntime to go to dinner.\nAnswer: I'll have to let you know,take care!\nTyrone Killebrew"}

More people go to my school than\nlive in Australia. I honestly believe that Ricky Williams is a god. I am\nopen-minded and spiritually in tune - except towards people who are\nclosed-minded and spiritually out of tune. You can see my dorm from Chicago\nfor it is as tall as Florida would be if it stood up. I protest everything\n-except protests. I am a gold card carrying member of Amnesty International.\nI am openly bi-curious. I am a Longhorn.\nTEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY I live in a town the size of a piece of\nbacteria on a fly's ass. I spend Friday nights practicing my yells. \nI can whoop better than anyone can in my battalion. I beat up faggots for\nfun. If\nI'm not yelling, drinking with my battalion, or beating up faggots \nfor fun, I am at the Dixie Chicken. My father went to school here, just as\nhis father\ndid before him, and his father before him. My brother went to tu. They never\nfound his body after he came home that first Christmas in college. I won't\nwalk on the grass. I look forward to the day I, too, will do the elephant\nwalk. I believe it is cool to do something because they tell me it is\ntradition. If something is not a tradition and we accidentally do it, we\nthen make it one. I can call UT \"tu\" if I want. I am an Aggie. BAYLOR\nUNIVERSITY I live by homeless vagrants, whom I turn my\nnose up I look just like everyone else at my school. The NoZe Brothers are\nthe coolest things since khakis and sandals. I have an Abercrombie and Fitch\neverything. I can co-ordinate outfits and ensembles better than anyone in my\nupscale apartment complex. I have radar that lets me know where the closest\nATM is. If I can't find one it's okay. I have ten credit cards all of which\nto my parents. My town is so conservative that anyone who kisses on the\nmouth\nbefore three years of marriage is drug through the town. I like me. I should\nbe an underwear model. I am a Bear.\nTEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY I live on a piece of dirt so flat that we call the\nfour degree incline at the intersection of 19th and Brownfield the big hill.\nI get dirt in my eyes, hair, and teeth when I walk to class. I can out drink\nanyone from any other school because that is what we do. If I'm not drunk by\n4:30pm, I'm high. I can't buy beer within 50 miles of where I>live - so I\ntrek to the strip, which my friends and I\nall consider a true paradise on Earth. I don't go to many football games. I\ndon't go to any organizational meetings. I don't really go to anything. Not\neven class. I like the fact that Will Rogers' horse's ass points to College\nStation. I fry cow balls. I know where Buddy Holly used to live. I am\ndesperately trying to find a rival within our conference to make fun of. Our\nfootball players get caught by the NCAA. If I'm not drunk by 4:30pm, I'm\nhigh. But I'm usually drunk by 4:30pm. Or I'm high. I am \na Red Raider.\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS (UNT) I am either a film geek or a musician.\nIf I am neither then you will find me hanging out on Fry Street dressed in\nmy punk garb. I think my school sucks yet I still attend school here. I wear\nt-shirts and hats from either A&M or UT because I wish I could've gotten in\nthere. On Thursdays you will find me shaking my thang at the Groovey Mule or\ndown in Deep Ellum. I think Denton is the scuzziest town ever and I bitch\nabout all the pot holes in the roads when I am driving anywhere in the city.\nMost of the people here are weird. Noone\nstays on the weekends. Noone has ever even heard of my school. On Sundays,\nthe whole town goes to church at Denton Bible. Damn, I really wish I\ncould've gotten into one of the other Texas colleges. I am a mean green\nEagle. Cawwww!\nTEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY (TCU) I am in a frat or sorority of course. I\ndrive a Lexus or Mercedes, and if I pass all my classes then Daddy said he\nwould buy me that little condo on Hulen next semester. I wear my diamonds\nand heels for football games and get dressed for bed and  THEN go to the\nbasketball games. Anyone and everyone goes to the Pub or Scooners, or to\nLonghorns and dance with old Mexican cowboys. We are having a J.Crew built\nin the bookstore next year and our send home credit cards apply at ALL times\nand locations. Where the girls' hair is as fake as their tans.

Pulizzi\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\nWASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Now that gasoline prices are finally settling down,\neconomists say another energy component could prove to be a spoiler on the\ngovernment's main consumer inflation gauge.\nAmid a shifting regulatory landscape and typical summertime price increases,\nthe nation's utilities appear to be boosting consumers' electricity bills\nenough to skew the Labor Department's July consumer price index. Those gains\nwould partly offset the anticipated favorable influence of recently\ndeclining gas prices.\n\"There is a real chance of starling increases in electricity prices over the\nnext month or two, thanks mostly to the bungled deregulation of the\nindustry,\" Ian Sheperdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics\nin Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a recent report. \"All the anecdotal evidence\nfrom the West and East Costs suggests consumers are reeling from sudden\ndouble - and in some cases triple - digit percentage increases in their\nbills.\"\nFirst Union economist Mark Vitner agreed: \"It is a potential trouble spot,\nit is a particular problem in the West.\" In California, where no new power\nplants have been built in a decade, the private companies that purchased\nplants from the state's utilities have been raising prices in response to\nstrong demand and dwindling supply.\nThe impact of the cost increases will be revealed Wednesday, when the Labor\nDepartment releases the July CPI next Wednesday.\nEconomists generally expect the figures to point to a continued tame\ninflation scenario - a 0.1% overall monthly increase, featuring declining\nclothing, computer and gas prices is forecast. Labor Department economist\nPatrick Jackman said recent statistics suggest gas prices fell 3% to 3.5%\nlast month. That would mark a departure from June, when soaring prices at\nthe nation's gas stations contributed to a big 0.6% spike in the CPI.\nRising Demand, Surging Prices\nBut electricity, which represents 2.5% of the entire index, will be a wild\ncard in the coming report.\nElectricity costs usually rise in the summer as consumers pay more for the\njuice that powers their air conditioners. This summer is no different,\nVitner said, adding that utilities have even more pricing power than normal.\n\"Overall demand for electricity has been rising. All this high-tech\nequipment uses a lot of electricity,\" Vitner said.\nIndeed, prices rose 0.8% in June after seasonal adjustments. Before those\nadjustments, prices surged a whopping 6.6% during the month.\nAs for a July increase, Jackman said \"it certainly is a possibility. The\nquestion is how are the seasonal factors are going to handle it.\"\nSheperdson, however, believes it's clear that electricity costs are on the\nrise. \"Three factors are driving prices higher,\" he said. \"First, flaws in\nthe auction system set up after deregulation effectively allow the\ngenerating companies to manipulate prices at times of high demand. Second,\nthe economic boom means that periods of high demand are much more common\nthan was anticipated at the time of deregulation, so generators have more\nopportunity to extract premium prices from distributors and, hence,\nconsumers. Third, little new electricity-generating capacity has been added\nin recent years.\"\nProducer prices, which Sheperdson says provide a good guide to movements in\nthe CPI, may offer ominous insight into the potential consumer electricity\nprice gains. Residential electric power prices on the producer level rose\nfaster in July than at any point since January 1991.\nAnd they aren't expected to slow down anytime soon. August could be\nespecially problematic because higher electricity costs will coincide with\nanother pickup in gas prices and continued gains in natural gas prices,\nVitner said.\n\"We have no idea how far the CPI measure of residential electricity prices\ncould rise, but there must be a good chance that substantial increases will\nbe recorded,\" Sheperdson said. \"With natural gas prices also climbing again,\nfollowing a dip in July, it may take a while before energy ceases to push\ninflation higher.\"\n-Henry J.

{"id": "1145", "contents": "RE: $.01 surcharge as \"tax\"\nThanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.\nBest,\nJeff\n\na legal memo follows\n\nA typical clause reads as follows:\n\" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include \"any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges\"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates.\"\nUnder the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes \"applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point\" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes \"applicable prior to the Delivery Point.\"  The surcharge would seem to be applicable \"at the Delivery Point.\"\nSupport for the argument that the surcharge is not a \"tax\" under the contracts:\n1.  The CPUC refers to it as a \"rate increase\"\n2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)\n3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities\n4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities\nSupport for the argument that the surcharge is a \"tax\" under the contracts:\n1.  Since the \"frozen tariff\" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a \"rate increase\"\n2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR\n3.  The definition of \"taxes\" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types\n4.

I really like the idea of weekly meetings.  Especially in the new building where we will be spaced out and not all sitting together, I think it would be good for team unity.  Even if the meeting is only 10 minutes long, it gives the group a chance to talk about what everyone is working on and projects that we can work with others on.  Also, with people joining East and leaving East, the meetings could give us a chance to get to know each other better.  I realize that meetings are not necessary every week, but 2 or 3 a month have very helpful and beneficial for me.\n2.  We were all going to give a small \"lesson\" on an area of our jobs that we have a strong knowledge about and present it to the others in our group.  Jeff has already given a lesson on NX3 Basis positions.  Although the lessons may be a little nerve wracking, I think they would be very useful to continue.  For example, the subjects of Liquidation, Storage, and OA are all areas I would like to know more about.\nThat's it really.  Thank you for all of your help so far with the Gulf4/5 \"merger\".

This guy is going to be my boss someday.\n\nThere is nothing in Deal Volume Tracking regarding this deal.  I checked with Rita Wynne and she says it needs to be pathed.  As soon as that is done and I am notified, we can get the invoice out to MidAmerican.\n\nPhil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.\n\nGood Job!  Please document the sale and the other bids, timing issues, costs, and any other factors that led to or affected the sale.  If you have any questions, please ask.\nEd\n\nJust sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.\n\nUpdate\nRobin and I are waiting to hear back from all of the following\ncompany                                                contact\nReliant Energy Services Inc.

David Jones  \n\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is \"zero-rated\"  so it is not subject to the GST.\nWade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  \nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\nStacy\nx3-5705\n\nDo you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?\nThanks,\nKay\n\nOpps.  Didn't mean to hit send it just yet.  Much better now. \n\nToday we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, \"Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months\".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. \nTomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will \n1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to \n2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.\nKay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? \nAny comments or questions? \nListed below are some of the companies ENA has done business with at Dawn \nAEP Energy Services, Inc.      \nAquila Canada Corp.    \nBP Canada Energy Company       \nCargill Energy Trading Canada, Inc.    \nCMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company    \nCoEnergy Trading Company       \nConsumers Energy Company       \nConsumers Gas Company Ltd., The\nCoral Energy Canada Inc.       \nDuke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership      \nDuke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.      \nDynegy Canada Inc.     \nDynegy Canada Marketing and Trade, a division of Dynegy Canada Inc.    \nEl Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.  \nEngage Energy Canada L.P.      \nNexen Marketing\nPanCanadian Petroleum Limited  \nPG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation\nPG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation    \nPhibro Inc.    \nReliant Energy Services, Inc.  \nSempra Energy Trading Corp.    \nTXU Energy Trading Canada Limited      \nWPS Energy Services, Inc."}

{"id": "8694", "contents": "California Update 3/15/01\nExecutive Summary\n? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for \npast utility debt\n? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short \nfor PG&E this summer \n? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy \nchances increase significantly among small generators and QFs\n? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions \nfor California\nCalifornia Public Utility Commission Rate Increases \nToday may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the \nDepartment of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to \nconsumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate \nhikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from \nconsumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of California's main consumer \nadvocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption, \nbut remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR, \nwhich is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to \nsecuritize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis' plan to \nsign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every \nday on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is \nessentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such \nas ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of \nFinance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other \nprograms) to purchase power, but DWR's hands are tied until revenue bonds are \nissued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a \nrecommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10 \nbillion worth of state bonds. \nDavis & PG&E at Odds \nSources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult \nchallenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer \ngroups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3), \nand 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the \nultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to \nlimit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The \nutilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars \nfurther in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their \nutility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is \nbeing hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the \nstates' 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would \nprovide Davis with even less negotiating power.\nWith all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state \nlegislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and \nState Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a \nspecial Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of \nprice manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.  \nDavis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being \npicked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.\nQF's Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy\nSacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience \nand force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been California's \nQualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing \nagainst PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QF's costs \nand provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the State's \nsenate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further \ninvestigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.\nOut with Hebert, In with Wood\nThe Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat \nWood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican \nLeader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.  \nThe administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a \nfight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states \nin 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made \nseveral token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power \nrefunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and \npower plant installation.  \nIt's is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal \nthat Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions \nmight include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well \nas other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in \nthe West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and \nbelieves in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering \nwhether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as \nBPA."}

If it is, then what\nobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery\npoint.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my\ninitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount\nand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to\nserve, and, although a \"mutually agreeable\" delivery point would have to be\nnegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.\nThe January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the\nright to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as\nwell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract\ngoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into\nthe city, \"the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such\nportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes\nof North Carolina. . .\"  The contract further provides that absent an order\nof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to\nserve all end users within the \"aforementioned\" area--presumably referring\nto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.\nSo, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably\ntracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I are\nlooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).\nThe 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of\ndevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement\nwith NCNG shall be \"at the following locations and other stations added at\nmutually agreeable locations in the future. . .\" In the Third Amendment to\nthe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and\ndelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included\nthat  other stations may be added at \"mutually agreeable locations in the\nfuture.\"  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to\ngive in exchange.

Just a couple of comments:\n1. General\nMay want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the \nsame ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's \n\"import-based\" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state \ninfrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about \n80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the \nin-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the \nlast decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border \nand a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.\nThe last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can \nwe support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?  \nIf we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we \nneed to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving \nFERC ammunition to take action without trying to \"steer\" that action in the \nright direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.\n2. Specific\nCompetition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The \nmidwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest \n(Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits \nthe California border.\nMary Hain@ECT\n12/12/2000 11:58 AM\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 12/12/2000 10:07 AM \n---------------------------\n\nHain/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard \nShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Maureen \nMcVicker/NA/Enron@Enron\n\nWe thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points \nwith any numbers that Enron provides.

I have recalculated the sheet sent earlier using the formula that CMS uses at its LNG unloading facility in Lake Charles.  This yields a slightly better result than we had.  I have also put in the correct dollar figures, as the prior sheet used the 2001 standard commodity charge only as opposed to the 2000 commodity charge and the Winter Cargo charge for the corresponding shipments.  I plan on calling Cabot today to start the process of getting a credit for the return vapors on these shipments.  Cabot will probably resist giving us the credit until we straighten out the sampling process at Eco, as they will be wanting credit for the proper amounts unloaded (we have been using load quality analysis for custody transfer due to problems with Eco's sampling system).\nI will work with Cabot to get the credit as soon as possible.

There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under \nthis category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are \nhitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  \nCurrently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  \nThe problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these \ncounterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the \nproducts after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.\nRISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies \nwith Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two \nlegs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment \nof FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the \nappropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for \nFinancial Swaps and not Physical deals.  \nIT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked \ncorrectly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will \nmost likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg \nMaintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to \ninstruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so \nlogic can be adjusted accordingly.\nDoes a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any \nfurther issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    \nPlease respond with your thoughts on this subject.\nThank you,\nDawn\n3-9353"}

Thanks df  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 03/22/2001 11:41 AM ---------------------------\n\nI think one area that needs to be clarified is that many nonVPs believe that if they have the expenditure authority they can sign contracts in connection with the expenditure they are approving even in the absence of a power of attorney. I think we need the policy to clarify the difference between expenditure authority and execution authority. Our various company bylaws state that only VPs and above have authority to sign contracts and bind the company unless the President of the company delegates execution authority. Therefore we either need POAs or delegations of authority for execution authority below VP. This policy needs to clarify this point. I have sent this to Drew and we will work up some new additional language.\n\nPlease review and provide comments to myself and/or Lisa Sutton.\n\nFYI, based on comments received, attached is the draft which will be distributed to Stan's direct reports for comments.

{"id": "6621", "contents": "ServiceCo\nKevin, given the track record of mis-behaviour, I don't fault you with the premise of guilt before understanding.  But I would like to assure you that despite the high valuations externally, which I probably agree are fantasy, The Facility Services Group has a clear vision/market; it has a quality management team; it will be under my thumb and it is conservatively valued in the books.  It is much more that a Blockbuster or other like structure.  If you would like to discuss in detail do not hesitate to give me a call and I will take you through it - both overall strategy and tactics.  Even though it has been a confluence of events which has caused our problems, the fundamental root of most issues is an inactive management team which hasn't managed the detail as well as we would like.  New Power in my view would not have been as big a loser if we had kept it private and managed it closely as a key part of the business.  Instead we took it public and let it run amok.  I think you can see parallels across the company.  Initially well intentioned and thought out strategies fall apart when not managed appropriately.\nRegards\nDelainey"}

Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  \nPat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  \nI recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. \nThe best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.\nMaurice\n\nDiann,\nWe have a few paths that we are looking into, including the one that we discussed w/ Maurice.

Then I smile, and you know, I loved it just as much as you did...

The measure passed on a party-line vote with no\nRepublican votes.  What makes SB 6x interesting to IEP members is that is\nprovides financing through the Authority for environmental improvements to\nexisting powerplants 30 years or older.  IEP testified in support of the\nbill if it was amended to bind Authority\u0001,s eminent domain powers.  Senator\nBurton agreed and IEP is currently drafting language on this issue.\nSimilarly, Burton agreed to work with Senator Morrow on language that would\nlimit the Authority to only supplementing private power generation and not\nbuilding power plants where they are not needed.   The amended version is\nattached.\nSB 33x, as amended, would authorize the Governor to enter into negotiations\nwith the IOUs to purchase their transmission system.  The Governor\u0001,s plan\nwould have to be approved by the Legislature by only a majority vote.  If\napproved the Treasurer would have the authority to issue revenue bonds to\npay for the transmission system.  This measure also passed on a party-line\nvote.  IEP submitted written opposition to the bill as introduced, but will\ncontinue to voice its concern with the state being both a market participant\nand owning the transmission system as the bill moves through the legislative\nprocess.  The amended version is not in print yet.\nPlease contact me if you have any questions.\nJulee Malinowski-Ball\nSenior Associate\nEdson + Modisette\n916-552-7070\nFAX-552-7075\njmball@ns.net\n- sbx1_6_bill_20010213_amended_sen.pdf"}

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe \nASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the \nMidwest ISO.  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to \nmake contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron \nsupporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.  The \nESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO \nthat is designed to support  a for-profit transco.  The consortium's primary \ncompetitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO \nenvironment (similar to California and PJM).\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/10/99 01:05 \nPM ---------------------------\n\"dsgeorge\" <dsgeorge@earthlink.net> on 09/09/99 11:00:36 PM\n\n\"Laurence Ferry\" <laurence.ferry@esca.com>, \"JD Hammerly\" \n<jd.hammerly@esca.com> \n\nKevin and Lloyd,\nThe Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow:\nAllegheny Power\nAmeren (formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company)\nCILCO\nCinergy\nCommonwealth Edison\nHoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative\nIllinois Power\nKentucky Utilities\nLouisville Gas & Electric\nNorthern States Power\nWabash Valley Power\nWisconsin Electric\nThe status of the formation is anti-profit, i.e. a holding pattern is in\nplace with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years.  The view is\nthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only a\nmandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERC\neven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.\nAt present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirement\nwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.\nNevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offer\nis a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you might\nexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as Program\nManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging and\nCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCA\nfor the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters our\noffering and provides more near-term opportunity.\nDiscussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharing\ninformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand how\neach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.

{"id": "8159", "contents": "unverified news report\nChina Blames U. S. for Second Mid-Air Collision\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese officials have stated that they are holding the\nUnited States, \"fully responsible\" for today's mid-air collision, involving\nseveral Chinese aircraft and one American craft. This comes just weeks after\na similar incident involving a U. S. spy plane.\nOfficials have stated that at approximately 8:25 a.m., GMT, a squadron of\nChinese F-8 fighters collided with the American Goodyear Blimp. The crash\nleft over a dozen Chinese planes downed and the blimp's electronic billboard\ndamaged. Sources say the billboard's scrolling marquee had been advertising\n7-UP soft drink, leaving the line \"Up yours\" in view.\nA Chinese pilot who witnessed the collision between his squadron, nicknamed,\n\"Panda Rash\" told China's Xinhua news agency that he saw the American blimp\ndive out of the clouds and into wingman Sum Yung Phucker's F-8 jet.\n\"I told Yung Phucker his tail was all broken. Keep it straight. Keep it\nstraight',\" said the pilot. \"He just couldn't shake the American\nforeign-devil. The blimp then reportedly veered hard left and then\nright,taking out the rest of the squadron.\nPilot Chawp Suey Wussy told Xinhua the American blimp was \"fully responsible\nfor the incident,\" repeating the language Beijing has used in the earlier\nincident. China blames this new accident on the Goodyear blimp, saying it\nrammed the supersonic fighters, and has demanded an apology.  Officials from\nthe Goodyear Company have said it is unlikely that the slow propeller-driven\nblimp could turn inside and ram a dozen nimble fighters, unless the Chinese\nwere testing chimp pilots.\n\"The direct cause of the collision was that the American blimp made a sudden\nbig move toward the Chinese planes, making it impossible for the Chinese\nplanes to get out of the way,\" Suey Wussy was quoted as saying.  \"The savage\nact of American blimps colliding with Chinese planes while conducting spying\nactivities at sporting events makes us indignant,\" he was quoted as saying.\nChinese officials are calling for an apology from the United States and\nenough Goodyear tires to replace the Firestone's that experienced\nspontaneous combustion last year. U. S. officials expressed regret, but\nwould not allow an apology until the matter could be investigated further.\nIn a related story Goodyear has not commented on whether it has stopped\nshipments of condoms to China as a retaliatory measure."}

{"id": "8761", "contents": "RE: NGPL Eddy Co.\nno.  Let me try and catch up with Rich.'\nDS\n\nDarrell - Did you ever find out what we have on the Atoka points regarding sulfur monitor?\n\nLorraine after looking over what volumes we'll be receiving we'll be needing a total sulphur instrument at this location. I understand NGPL has one at the Indian Basin Plant which is an Old Barton Recorder type. These type of instruments will not pick up all the sulphur we're experiencing out of the field in that area. We have instruments that will pick up butyl sulphur along with many others that most other companies equipment can't read at this time. We're also experiencing large amounts of butyl which is a major problem for us in the Atoka field. By receiving this into our system we're having to batch or inject corrosion inhibitor's in our pipelines for protection. This is a cost to operations that we need to get a handle on. Thanks for your help in this matter\nRJ\n---------------------- Forwarded by Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron on 10/02/2001 02:18 PM ---------------------------\n<< OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> \nRich Jolly\n10/02/2001 11:07 AM\n\nPerry I agree with Arnie and the team. In order to keep our pipelines in good shape we need to know what we are receiving, especially from these larger delivery points. It seems like every time we agree to something different than what we require operations has to go back to marketing for dollars or put in equipment to correct the situation. We're trying to cover all bases up front so this doesn't happen in the future.\nThanks\nRJ\n<< OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> \t  From:  Arnie Bailey                           10/01/2001 02:59 PM\t\n\nPerry,\nThe Artesia Team and I still have concerns about having no total sulfur monitor at the location.  We are already taking gas that has high total sulfur at Atoka 2.  Since we have started using sulfur instruments that pick up Butyl Sulfur, we are almost always over .75 grains at Atoka 2 into the West Texas lateral.  The instruments that NGPL uses at the Indian Basin plant may not see Butyl Sulfurs.  If this it the case, we may have the same problem that we have at Atoka 2.  If we don't have enough other inputs to blend the gas, this can become a quality problem for deliveries at other locations. \nSince this is a 50mmcfd input to our system, I sure think we need the protection.\nThanks,  Arnie\n\nLaura & Earl:\nPlanning and Gas Control can accept control valve operation by NGPL, which is included in the current drawings.  The installation of 2 control would give us problems with them fighting each other.  We have an OBA with NGPL, and we will monitor their future compliance to volume requirements.   We might have to address in this in the future if the fail to comply, but for now we're okay.\nNGPL has basically the same tariff as TW and they feel protected from total sulfur at the tailgate of the Indian Basin Plant.  The Delmar H2S at the NGPL/TW point  will protect us both from H2S.  We may want to grab a sample from the IB plant to baseline the current sulfur content and verify accuracy.  Darrell and myself are comfortable with the current plans, to not install total sulfur at our interconnect with NGPl.  The cost of this new instrument is around $40,000 and I don't believe either company has plans to replace,  NGPL total sulfur instrument.\nArnie and Terry, please review and let us know if Operations can comply with our findings.  I am sure this can be resolve to our mutual agreement.  \nPTF  713-853-0667\n\nHere are the meeting notes.  ljk\n<<mtg notes on NGP Eddy IC.doc>>\n\nPT;  Attached are the notes from the meeting with NGPL, aka Kinder Morgan,\nat the NGPL Eddy County Interconnect yesterday.  Earl has asked me to\nsubmit a work order for TW's work on this project and before I do that, I\nneed some answers on the marketing issues that we discussed on the phone\nyesterday.  Mainly,  I need to know if I should plan on using NGPL's valve\nfor flow control, or if I should plan to install a new one.\nWould it be possible to have an answer on that by the close of\nbusiness tomorrow?  NGPL has a required in-service date of 12-30-01 and\nare planning to have everything ready to flow gas by 12-15-01, which\ndoesn't give us much time to get a flow control valve ordered, if one is\nrequired, not to mention the Bristol.\nLaura J.

This definition, I \nbelieve, describes agreements like the ISDA Master  Agreement.\n2) Both versions amend Section 362(b) (the exceptions to the automatic stay) \nto provide for a concept that permits setoffs with respect to amounts due and \nclaims under one or more master netting agreements or any contract or \nagreement that is subject to such master netting agreements.  Mark and I \nthink that through this provsion, cross-product netting would be permitted to \nthe extent our physical and financial contracts separately or collectively \ncome under a master netting agreement.  We wanted to confirm that that was \nthe intent of this language since it is not entirely clear from the drafted \nlanguage how this would work if for example we had separate netting \nagreements for our physical and financial contracts.  In addition, as \ncurrently drafted, the only caveat to this setoff right is that these rights \nare derivative of the setoff rights that are permitted by Sections 362 (b) 6 \n(forward contarcts), 7 (repos) and 17 (swaps) with respect to each individual \ncontract.    This may still present some problems for us in that no \namendments were made to Section 362 (b) 6 which permits setoffs with respect \nto forward contracts but only to the extent that our claim against the debtor \nis for a margin payment or a settlement payment .  We were hoping to see an \namendment to this Section that  broadened this language to include any type \nof payment that would be due from the debtor under a forward contract  since \nwe are still unclear as to what a \"settlement\" payment means.  If you look at \nSection 362 (b) 17 which deals with swaps, this language is much broader and \nit was our hope that the setoff language for forward contracts could track \nthe setoff language for swaps.  Also, we were hoping that the setoff language \nfor forward contarcts would apply to anyone taht was a party to a forward \ncontract and not just \"forward contract merchants\" as currently drafted.  \nAgain, the swap setoff language has a concept of \"swap participant\" that is \nmuch broader.\n3) Finally, we like the fact that the definition of \"swap agreement\" was \nexpanded, but are concerned with the new language and how it would apply to \nour newer products such as weather derivatives since in order to fit within \nthe new definition, it must be something that is currently or in the future \n\"regularly\" entered into in the swap market.  There are some further \nrevisions to that definition which I want to discuss with you as well.\nIn summary, while this language gives us some stronger argumants with respect \nto \"cross-product\" netting, we feel that it doesn't go far enough.  Mark has \ncalled Cadwalader to get their read on the draft language.  Call me when \nconvenient so that we can discuss what the next step for us may be.\nCarol"}
{"id": "9579", "contents": "FW: Important - Position Manager Rollout\nIt is now time to roll out the new position manager into production.  By replacing our current excel based curve files and west tot position files we will dramatically increase the reliability of our risk systems.  For example, twice in the last week the Portland Risk Group and Houston's technology group had to work late into the night because of Access database problems.  By switching to the new Position Manager / Curve File tool, we will be able to eliminate those Access databases and increase the reliability of the Portcalc.\nI have been using the new position manager for the last month and really like it.  It is really fast and flexible.  You can save a bunch of different profiles.  Information can be easily exported to excel.\nOn June 27th we will no longer be using the existing curve files and west tots.  We will only use the new position manager to submit data to our risk systems and receive data from our risk systems.  You can continue to use whatever file you want to build your curves, but the curves must be loaded into the new position manager and uploaded through the new position manager.  Normal Lee will be up here next week to help us during the transition period.  Starting today we should begin running in complete parallel.  Sometime next week we should cut over to the new position manager and if any issues come up Norman will be here to help.\nI appreciate your help with this.  I know that it's a pain to switch, but I am confident that the new position manager, once we are comfortable with it, will be better for everyone.  Sanjay's development team has done a great job with this tool and is prepared to fully support us during this rollout.  Quality of life should improve for both the risk group and the technology team.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns."}

{"id": "303", "contents": "RE: Enfolio agreement - CSU\nAfternoon,\nI was able to go through Colorado Springs financials, but was unable to distinguish between natural gas system operations and the general \"utility\", outside of book value of the various gas, electric and water plants.  As such, if we are unable to acquire statements for the gas system itself, I don't think we can agree to CSU's redline of Scope of Agreement (point # 1 below).  \n\nMax,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.\nI am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.\nTyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?  \n\nA couple of thoughts regarding the redline:\n1) Scope of Agreement: ..\"judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations..\"  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.\n2) Scope of Agreement:  \"Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council.\"  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  \n3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  \nGive me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.  \n(713) 345-8261  \nthanks.  \n\nMax,  Please see attached redline from Colorado Springs.

{"id": "715", "contents": "2001 Earnings\nPeggy asked that I update you on our earnings forecast for this year.\nPGE had an exceptional April with PGE IBIT of $39.8 million compared to $5.2\nmillion budget and Net Income of $20.9 million compared to -$.7 million plan. \nEarnings for the month were driven primarily by our wholesale business and\noutstanding plant operations.  Actual net variable power cost for April came\nin at $.2 million compared to our budget of$43.9 million.  Retail loads were\noff for the month which created additional length along with strong wholesale\nprices in the preschedule and real time markets.  \nApril results do not include any charges for Enron overheads which we would\nexpect to start occurring in May.  Kirk Stevens and Mark Lindsey are working\non getting these charges allocated to PGE.\nFor Q2, our Current Forecast for PGG is to over perform at plan by $1.7\nmillion IBIT and 6.3 net income.  The primary driver will still be power cost\nfor May and June.   Recent downward movement in the forward curve has reduced\nthe value of our long position in May and June on a forecast basis.  However,\nthe preschedule and real time markets continue to be strong.  If this trend\ncontinues then we should over perform in both May and June.  How much is still\nhighly dependent on wholesale prices, our plant operations, retail loads and\nweather conditions in the West.  \nFor the year, we are still on track to make our plan but a similar situation\nto the second quarter exists for us in the third and fourth quarter.  We are\nholding on to some length in our retail book to hedge our retail load and\nplant operations.  The value of that length changes on a forecast basis based\nupon movement in the forward curve.  However, we continue to see the\npreschedule and real time market trade higher than the forward curve.  In\naddition, as we discussed before, we have a regulatory mechanism in place\nwhere by we share our overall net variable power cost with customers.  Our\ncurrent power cost forecast has us in the 90 / 10 sharing bandwidth with\ncollection of about $18 million from customers.  If wholesale prices in the\npreschedule and real time market continue to be strong then we will move into\nthe dead band and could move into the refund zones.

Hill, International \nPresident of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), \nissued the following statement. \n\"Pacific Gas and Electric's filing for bankruptcy could make a dire situation \nin California even worse. On behalf of the 13,500 IBEW Local Union 1245 \nmembers employed by PG&E and the public they serve, we believe it is \nimperative that constructive action be taken now.\n\"Specifically, we call on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to \nstop dragging its feet and impose price controls on the wholesale electricity \nmarket in California. It is obvious that price gouging by wholesale suppliers \nhas bled dry the investor-owned utilities and precipitated this crisis. The \nstate has purchased power in an effort to prop up the system, but it too has \npaid the same inflated prices. This only threatens California's budget \nsurplus and places an unfair burden on taxpayers while doing nothing to \naddress the root of the problem.\n\"We also believe that it is time for government and industry to work together \nto jump start projects to improve the interconnected transmission grid in the \nWestern states so that power can be quickly and efficiently moved to where it \nis needed. Prompt action on such projects could have helped alleviate the \ncurrent problems, and they should commence with all due speed.\n\"Another factor that has driven the crisis is the lack of adequate generation \nfacilities to power the growth of California and other Western states. We \nurge the Western Governors Association to take the lead in helping to chart a \ncourse that will bring more facilities on line and provide short and long \nterm solutions to these difficulties.\n\"Even though we have been assured that PG&E employees will still be paid, and \nwe know that their pensions are protected by law, we will fight to ensure \nthat our collective bargaining rights are honored during this process. We \nwill work with our Local Union 1245, utility management, Governor Davis and \nall other parties to restore sanity and reliability to California's gas and \nelectricity systems.\" \nSOURCE International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \n/CONTACT: Jim Spellane of the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers, 202-728-6014/ \nDuke Energy Statement Regarding Pacific Gas & Electric Company Filing for \nChapter 11 Reorganization\nPR Newswire\n04/06/01, 4:34p\n(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK) \ntoday issued the following statement: \nWe regret that the collective actions to mitigate Pacific Gas & Electric's \n(PG&E) financial crisis were unsuccessful in keeping it from filing for \nChapter 11 reorganization.

There are several significant financial, \nlegislative and regulatory differences that distinguish Sempra Energy and \nSDG&E from PG&E.\"\nSDG&E is covered under Assembly Bill 265, a law signed by the Governor last \nSeptember which guaranteed that SDG&E will be able to collect the difference \nbetween the capped price of electricity and the wholesale cost of power, \nproviding the power was prudently purchased. PG&E is not covered by AB 265 \nand that guarantee. At the end of February, the under-collection in the \nbalancing account was $681 million. Since the state's power procurement \nagency, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), has been \npurchasing power for SDG&E, the growth of the company's balancing account has \nslowed significantly.\nUnlike PG&E, SDG&E has been able to pay its wholesale electric bills to the \nDWR, the California Independent System Operator, the California Power \nExchange and Qualifying Facilities that cogenerate power for the utility. \nAdditionally, the Sempra Energy companies have no significant credit exposure \nto PG&E.\n\"Sempra Energy and SDG&E have long advocated that the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission institute temporary regional wholesale price caps to \nhelp stem the financial problems such as those experienced by PG&E,\" Baum \nadded. \"We are also committed to promoting and instituting comprehensive \nenergy conservation programs for all customers to help control bills and \ndecrease the chances of rotating outages this summer.\"\nSempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500 energy \nservices holding company with 12,000 employees and annual revenues of $5.4 \nbillion.

Place and \nagenda to follow once this date is nailed up.   The heads of each group will \ndecide who will attend.  We would also invite Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom \nGros, Ted Seitz and Jean Mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by \nthe Technical folks.\nAs before, the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups \nwithin Enron and to exchange ideas and issues.  The Enron research team will \nprovide trading and modeling presentations and the Optical Network \nEngineering team will present networking and components related topics.\nTake away from the two days will be to provide John Griebling's group with \nbetter understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general \nand energy markets in particular via Enron (i.e.,  how the sausage was \nmade!).  Likewise, John's group will provide us with better understanding of \noptical networking from a technical perspective.  Particularily, how EBS is \nplanning to develop the Puplic Switched Optical Network (PSON) that John has \n'branded' our pooling point based network!\nPlease reply ASAP if these two days (April 14 & 15) will work.  Additionally, \nJohn, is the original suggestion to hold it in Scott Yeager's cabin somewhere \nup in Colorado mts. still holds?  If yes, I should probably let Scott know!  \nIf not, I'll try to find other places--any suggestions, anyone? \nRegards,\nRavi."}

Due to high security \nrisk, Enron has elected to hire Harza for the full scope of the due \ndiligence.  The privatization includes hydro and thermal generation and \ntransmission, accounting for over 30% of Colombia's energy supply.\nProject Dragon, Asia - The Environmental Schedule of the Share Purchase \nAgreement was circulated for review by Bruce Lundstrom, APAChi Legal.  Copies \nwere forwarded to Frank Smith for comment.  The lenders have begun their due \ndiligence in Hong Kong and key discipline leaders are on standby to answer \nquestions.  A TransitionsTeam may be deployed in October/November.  This deal \nis still very confidential and Enron Asia power plants and personnel do not \nknow anything.\nENEL, Nicaragua - Don Stevens has requested Ramiro Garcia to review proposed \nlegislation for Nicaragua to assist in the evaluation of its potential \nimpact.  The proposal is very stringent and does not have much chance of \nsuccess; however, Enron has learned some of the other bidders are addressing \ncapital costs associated with the potential requirements.  The bid date is \nOctober 12.\nAnnual Report - Many technical and management problems have plagued the Image \nCenter's pdf of the Annual Report.  Gavin Dillingham succeeded in the posting \nand publication of the final edition.  Hard copies will likely be ready next \nFriday for distribution to Executive Staff.\nValuation Exercise - Susan, Henry, Jeff, and Marc all provided input on the \nEHS value to Enron exercise.  An additional meeting was held with Gia to \nexplain some of the tasks.\nEES/Eli Lilly Deal - Susan Worthen participated in several meetings with both \nEES and Eli Lilly to learn more about the scope of services and EES' EHS \nmanagement system.  A more detailed meeting with EES's Enron Building \nServices Inc. group will be held next week.  An EHS briefing has been \nscheduled for September 13 to answer Eli Lilly's environmental due diligence \nquestions."}
{"id": "8791", "contents": "Definition of Quasi-rent\nThere are several potential definitions of quasirent in the economics\nliterature.

I apologize for\nany sudden panic attacks this causes.\nQuasi-rent should be considered as equal to your sunk costs.  This is the\namount another business can hold you up for after your entry.  If I have\nto sink 5 million dollars to enter, my quasi-rent will be 5 million\ndollars, which I may be held up for after I enter.   Thus in solving\nholdup problems, you can consider it two ways.  1.  The potential holdup\namount is equal to the quasirent which equals the sunk cost at that point.\nor 2. How much does a firm have to receive to continue to produce AFTER\nsinking their sunk costs.\nI hope this definition has cleared the haze which I am at least partially\nresponsible.

{"id": "5466", "contents": "FW: PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison BREAKING NEWS\n IMPORTANT\nREAD DASOVICH'S SUMMARY WHICH FOLLOWS THE PRESS RELEASE BELOW.  gac\n\nImportance:\tHigh\nPUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates\nThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:\n?\tEdison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.\n?\tEdison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.\n?\tEdison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.\n?\tThe PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. \n?\tThe PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.\n?\tThe PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. \n?\tThere are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.\n?\tEdison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.\n\"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,\" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  \"The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.\"\nThis agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.\n\nIn another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding \"litigation.\"  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:\nThe Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003\nAny \"overcollection\" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called \"undercollection\")\nIf Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change\nIf Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.\nAny refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.\nEdison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.\nEdison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.\nEdison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.\nEdison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)\nThe PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure\nEdison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the \"filed rate doctrine\" and 2) the so-called \"TURN\" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.\nEdison agrees to \"cooperate\" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.\nThe PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the \"special\" session that the Governor recently announced\nWe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.\nBest,\nJeff\n\nIn what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.\nThe vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.\nDavis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.\nWhat is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?\nIt would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.\nIt would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.\nWhat are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?\nWith the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.\nThe political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.\nIt remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.\nUnder the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.\nIn short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.\nSafe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to \"solving\" California electricity crisis in shambles.\nWhat Next?\nA broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.\nThe bill would create a \"dedicated rate component\" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.\nProponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the \"dedicated rate component\" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.\nThe bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.\nAll four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.\nDavis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.\nGiven today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.\nUpdate on Edison Bailout\nStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another \"special\" session next Tuesday.\nIf you have any questions, just let us know.\nBest,\nJeff"}

(this will then\nmatch section 2.2.3.2, which has the correct spacing/alphanumbering).\nOn p.22 and p.37, we'd like to drop the reference to \"U.S.\" in the reference\nto a letter of credit issued by a major \"U.S.\" financial institution.\nSoCalGas has realized that it has already had dealings with Canadian or\nother foreign-owned customers where it was reasonable to rely on letters of\ncredit from major financial institutions of the parent's country.  (This\nshould be ok with Paul Amirault, eh?)\nB. Btu content\nOn pp.10 (twice) and 31, the settlement says we are assuming 1,016 Btu/mcf\nfor the heating value of gas (subject to revision by Commission during term\nof settlement).  We have the wrong units.  It is 1,016 Btu per cubic foot,\nnot per thousand cubic feet.  We'd propose to change the number to 1,016\nBtu/cf (not \"1,016 Btu/mcf\")  On p.33, we got the units right the first time\nand don't need to change them on that page.\nAgain, I'd appreciate you getting back to me or Brian Cherry by noon Friday\nif you have any problem with the above changes.\n-- Glen Sullivan\n\nMark'; 'Dasovich, Jeff'; 'Beach, Tom'; 'Burkholder, John'; 'Amirault,\nPaul'; 'Alexander, Michael'; 'Chancellor, Craig'; 'Dingwall, B.';\n'Douglass, Dan@SES'; 'Fawcett, Jeff'; 'Porter, Doug'; 'Rochman,\nMichael'; 'Counihan, Rick'; 'Bayless, David'; 'Paul, Joe'; 'Jimison,\nJohn'; 'Foss, Robert'; McVay, Nancy W - TPNWM; 'Scott, Susan'; 'Karp,\nJoe'; 'Johnson, Pamela'; 'gileau, patrick'\n\nFollett, B.

The table of contents was seriously messed up by an \"automatic update\"\nfeature in Word just before we duplicated and filed.  I will be putting it\nback to the state you saw in the final draft.\n2.  On p.7, section 1.12, put a period at the end of the last sentence.\n3.  On p.9, section 1.1.3.1,  two thirds of the way down the page, I will be\nchanging \"subject to adjustment annual by the base rate PBR formula\" to\n\"subject to adjustment annually by the base rate PBR formula\".\n4. On p.27, section 1.5.4, in the third full paragraph on the page, I will\nbe changing \"If only one customer has an OFO day\" to \"If only one customer\nclass has an OFO day\".\n5.  Also on p.27, section 1.5.4, bottom line on the page, I will be filling\nin the blank with \"C\" (so it reads \"Appendix C\")\nIn the category of \"maybe substantive\",\n1.  On p.10, section 1.1.3.2, three lines from the bottom of the page, the\ndate \"October 1, 2000\" would be changed to \"October 1, 2001\".  This sentence\nrefers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers\nbuying gas from SoCalGas in the \"procurement\" rate.  Obviously, our intent\nwas to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission, which\nhappens on October 1, 2001.\nIn the category of \"substantive\":\n1.  Our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled \"additional\"\n(non-reliability) storage for CTAs effective upon implementation of the\nsettlement (See p.4).  The filed settlement managed to drop the section that\nprovided for this option for CTAs prior to the principal storage change on\nApril 1, 2001.  (The filed settlement is ok for the period starting April 1,\n2001).  So, to be consistent with the term sheet, we need to insert\nsomething back into the settlement to allow CTAs to opt out of\nnon-reliability storage in the period from the effective date (90 days after\napproval) to April 1, 2001.  Obviously, this may not be a very long period.\nJohn Leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of Section\n5.4.4.3:  \"In the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of\nthis Settlement Agreement, and....[continue with current text].\"  We would\nneed to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanism/pricing\nfor SoCalGas purchasing gas in storage owned by CTAs if they opt out of\nnonreliability storage prior to April 1. 2001.  SoCalGas and SDG&E are ok\nwith John's language and want to make sure it is ok with other signatories.\nIf you have any problems with any of these changes, please contact me or\nBrian Cherry by noon on Friday, April 28.

Call me if you have any questions.\nThanks\n<< File: MARGAS.xls >> \n\nSold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/27-29/02 at $3.05.\n\nSold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/26//02 at $3.24\nAlso received a call from Jeff at Lone Star telling us to work a little harder at working off the imbalance.\n\nSold 10,.000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/25 at $3.29\n\nWe sold 10,000 dth of the Conger gas to TXU for 4/24 at $3.40\n\nOK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.\nSabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.\n\nSold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37\nOur scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.\nTheresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.\n\nI've sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.14 for Sat.4/20 through Mon. 4/22\nSabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas\n\nSold TXU 15,000 dth at $3.315 for Fri 4/19/02.  \nSabra, I sold them 10,000 of Conger gas and 5,000 of the Sprayberry.  \n\nSold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.\n\nSold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.27 for Wednesday 4/17/02."}
